    "Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the turkey and cook until the color changes, about 5 minutes. Next add the onions and cook till translucent. Then add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Next add the stock, hot sauce, chipotles, tomato paste, chili powder and cumin. Cook it on very low heat, covered, for about 40 minutes. Add three-quarters of the bacon, saving one-quarter for garnish, and cook for an additional 20 minutes, uncovered. Add salt if needed. Serve topped with the chopped bacon and sliced avocado with tortilla chips.",
