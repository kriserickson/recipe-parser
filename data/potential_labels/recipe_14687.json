    "Sprinkle lamb with 1/2 t salt and the pepper.\n2. Coat with flour.\n3. Heat oil in a 2 to 3 quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat.\n4. Brown lamb a few pieces at a time in the hot oil.\n5. Remove to crock pot with slotted spoon.\n6. Reduce heat to medium.\n7. Add onion and cook 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally until lightly browned.\n8. Stir in the wine, scraping up browned bits on bottom of pot.\n9. Transfer onion mixture to the crock pot; add carrots and potatoes and broth.\n10. Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, adding peas during the last 30 to 45 minutes.\n11. Note: I have also simmered this in the Dutch oven on the stove for 1 1/2 to 2 hours and it is very good."
