    "Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Pour in enough oil to fill the pan about 1/4-inch deep. Season the beef generously with salt and pepper, and add to the pan. Saute half the meat, uncovered, stirring only occasionally, until well-browned, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beef to a plate. Repeat with the remaining beef. Discard the oil and wipe out the pan.",
    "Return the pan to the stove and melt the butter over medium high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 1 minute more. Add the reserved beef and scatter the flour over the vegetable and beef mixture (enough to lightly coat) and cook stirring until lightly toasted. Add the broth, and bring to a simmer. Place potatoes, carrots and celery in slow cooker and season with salt/pepper. Poor the pan contents into cooker, mix with vegetables and place parsley, thyme, and bay leaves on top. Cook for 5 hours on high.",
    "Remove and discard the herbs on top.",
    "Pour into large pot and simmer to reduce to desired thickness, adding flour if necessary."
