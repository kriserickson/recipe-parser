    "Heat oven to 400Â°. In a bowl, whisk together yogurt, vinegar and sugar. Dice half the onion; add diced onion, avocado and cucumber to yogurt mixture; toss to coat. In a food processor, process portobello, edamame, garlic and remaining half of onion until finely chopped. Add chicken, soy sauce and cayenne. Pulse until chicken is chopped and ingredients are combined, about 12 times. Form mixture into 4 patties. Heat oil in a large oven-safe skillet over high heat. Add patties and cook, turning once, until both sides are browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place skillet in oven; bake until patties are cooked through, 12 to 14 minutes. Place lettuce, if desired, and patties on bottom halves of muffins; top each with 1/2 cup avocado mixture and remaining muffin half."
