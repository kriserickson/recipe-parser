    "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the olive oil, the rosemary, garlic and parsley. Let steep while the potatoes roast. Spread potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Season with the salt and toss with the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Roast on lower rack until golden on one side, about 10 minutes. Flip and roast until golden on the other side and potatoes are cooked through and very crispy, about 10 minutes more. Immediately dump hot potatoes in the bowl with the garlic-rosemary mixture and toss to coat. Season with black pepper. Use tongs to lightly crush potatoes then toss again to let the exposed parts of potato get coated with oil. Serve immediately. You can pick out some or all of the rosemary and garlic before serving if you like."
