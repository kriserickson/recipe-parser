    "Beat together cake mix, oil, eggs, and milk with an electric mixer or stand mixer for a few minutes until batter is smooth. Spray slow cooker with nonstick spray so the cake won’t stick. Pour mixture into the slow cooker and smooth over the bottom. Beat together the 2 cups milk and pudding and pour over the top. Do not stir. Then sprinkle chocolate chips over top without stirring. Cover and cook on high for 2 and 1/2 hours. You’ll know when it is done when the outsides and top set up like a sponge- the middle will be gooey. Serve with vanilla ice cream if desired. Serves 12. Enjoy!"
