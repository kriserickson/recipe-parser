    "Cut each pork chop into three strips. To wrap the \"wings,\" start by overlapping the bacon on one end of a pork strip, then wrapping it up and around in a candy-cane fashion. Secure the bacon at the top with a toothpick. If you need to use a toothpick at both ends, go ahead. Season the bacon-wrapped wings liberally with the rub.",
    "Prepare your cooker to cook indirectly at 235Â°F using medium pecan wood for smoke flavor. Place the wings directly on the cooking grid and cook for 90 minutes, or until the bacon is cooked. You may want to finish these on a hot grill or under the broiler to crisp the bacon. Serve hot with barbecue sauce for dipping."
