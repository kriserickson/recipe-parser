    "Prepare strips of mushrooms, cutting them along. Usually 3 strips out of each mushroom.",
    "Scatter the strips in a pan (glass, ceramic or stainless steel) and sprinkle over them the thyme, basil, vegetable powder, salt, water. Stir gently, to distribute the spices uniformly.",
    "Leave in the oven at 392 degrees F (200 degrees C) for about 15 min, until they slightly soften, but still have a crunchy texture.",
    "Grate or press the garlic, chop the parsley and the red pepper and mix the three, with the fingers. Sprinkle the mixture over the mushrooms and stir in very gently.",
