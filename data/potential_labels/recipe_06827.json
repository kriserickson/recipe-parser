    "Place on baking tray and pour in chicken stock. Place chicken in oven and immediately turn down to 400F. The chicken will cook for 20 minutes per 450g (1 lb) plus an added 20 minutes at the end. Baste the chicken at the halfway mark.",
    "For the glaze, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and then paint on to chicken in the last 15 minutes.",
    "Once the chicken is cooked (juices run clear) take out of pan and cover. With a spoon skim off the fat that’s in the pan and add the orange juice and chicken stock. Dissolve the cornstarch in a bit of cold water and add to the gravy stirring until the desired thickness."
