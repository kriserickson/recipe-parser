    "Finely slice 2 sticks of lemongrass and 4 spring onions. Seed and finely chop a small red or yellow chilli, and peel and grate a walnut-sized piece of ginger. Technique: Chopping chillies Watch technique 0:52 mins",
    "Slice 4 limes in half, and squeeze them into a bowl. Pour in the fish sauce and stir in the caster sugar.",
    "Get a wok hot and then pour in the vegetable oil. Add the lemongrass, onions, chilli and ginger and stir-fry them briefly. They should soften rather than colour. Pour the lime juice mixture into the wok then scatter on the coriander leaves and basil.",
    "Place the mackerel filets skin-side down on a grill pan. Place them under a hot grill until the flesh turns opaque. Remove the pan from the heat and spoon the aromatic topping onto the fish. Return to the grill for 5 minutes or so until the mixture starts to brown. Serve at once."
