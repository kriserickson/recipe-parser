    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then add the gnocchi. Continue to boil for about three minutes, or until the gnocchi begin to float. Once they're all floating, drain the gnocchi in a colander.",
    "Mince the two cloves of garlic and add them to a large skillet with the olive oil. Sauté the garlic over medium heat for about one minute, or just until it's soft and fragrant. Once soft, add the drained gnocchi and continue to sauté until the gnocchi gets slightly golden brown and crispy on the outside (don't stir too often or you'll prevent it from browning and crisping).",
    "Once the gnocchi is slightly crispy, add the pasta sauce and frozen chopped greens. Stir to combine, then allow to heat through (about 5 minutes). Sprinkle the Parmesan over the skillet, then the shredded mozzarella. Place a lid on the skillet and allow the cheese to heat and melt. Once melted, the gnocchi is ready to serve."
