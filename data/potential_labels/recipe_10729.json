    "Start by cutting 1½ pounds of chicken breasts into chunks (about 1 – 1½ cubes). Mix together soy sauce, cornstarch, and water. Add the chicken and stir to coat. Allow the chicken to marinate for 5 minutes.",
    "While it is marinating, prepare the orange sauce so that it is ready when you need it later. Whisk together fresh squeezed orange juice, dark brown sugar, cornstarch, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, orange zest, and optional sriracha sauce. Set aside.",
    "Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Remove the chicken from the marinade with a slotted spoon and carefully add it to the skillet. Stir-fry the chicken, over medium-high heat, for 5-7 minutes until golden and cooked through.",
    "Add the orange sauce to the chicken and cook for 4-6 minutes, stirring often until the sauce has thickened.",
    "Top with sesame seeds and sliced green onions, if desired. Serve over rice or noodles."
