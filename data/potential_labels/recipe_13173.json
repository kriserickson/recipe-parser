    "Combine all ingredients except water in food processor. Process until a smooth thick paste. Add in enough water, while it's running through the top, until it is smooth with a spreading consistency. ( I think I may have used about 1/3 cup...but put in as much or as little as you desire for the consistency you like) Garnish with some extra virgin olive oil. (not included in the nutrition info above) Serve with pita, pita chips, crackers or assorted raw vegetable dippers. It may taste a bit garlicky at first, but as the hummus sits the garlic flavor mellows.",
    "Store any leftovers covered in refrigerator."
