    "In a small bowl, whisk 1 can (14 oz) light coconut milk, 3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth, 2 tbsp sugar and 1 to 2 tbsp yellow curry paste (use more for a spicier curry). Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a stockpot over medium-high. Add 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch pieces, and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes. Remove to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Add 1 head trimmed cauliflower, cut into florets, to a pot and cook 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in coconut milk mixture and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer 6 minutes. Uncover pot and add chicken, with any accumulated juices, and 4 trimmed and sliced scallions. Simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1 tbsp cornstarch. Stir 1 can (15 oz) drained and rinsed chickpeas, cornstarch mixture and 3/4 tsp salt into pot. Raise heat to medium-high and cook 3 minutes. Serve with basmati rice, if desired.",
