    "Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 12 cups of a muffin pan with paper liners.",
    "Make the muffins: Whisk together coconut flour, baking soda, and sea salt in a small bowl. In another small bowl, combine 1/2 cup mashed banana, eggs, and coconut milk. Mix with a hand mixer until well blended. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and mix with a hand mixer until well combined. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups with an ice-cream scoop, filling each cup about 3/4 of the way.",
    "Make the topping: In a small bowl, combine cinnamon, 1/8 cup (2 tablespoons) of mashed banana, melted coconut oil, and maple syrup. Drizzle mixture over top of muffins and, using a toothpick, swirl the topping into the muffin batter. Reserve some of the cinnamon topping.",
    "Bake muffins for 20-25 minutes or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. In the last 5 minutes of baking add more cinnamon topping to the tops of the muffins. Allow muffins to cool in pan 5-10 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Enjoy immediately, but I prefer them the next day…..if they last that long. Enjoy!",
    "*Makes 12 muffins. Entire recipe has about 4 protein and 4 carb, so each muffin contains about 1/3 protein and 1/3 carb."
