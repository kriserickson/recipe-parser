    "1. Slice apples thin, about ¼ inch thick. Arrange apple slices on a plate in a single layer.",
    "2. In a small saucepan, melt chocolate chips and coconut oil for 20 second intervals on low heat, stirring in between, until almost completely melted. Stir any unmelted pieces until they melt (this prevents the chocolate from burning).",
    "3. Drizzle melted chocolate and almond butter over the apple slices and sprinkle with raisins and shredded coconut."
