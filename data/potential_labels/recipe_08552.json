    "In a food processor or blender, pulse the soup to a coarse puree. Return the soup to the pot and bring to a simmer. Add the broccoli florets and simmer until they are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar cheese into the soup, and serve the soup topped with the remaining cheese. Sprinkle bacon bits on top."
