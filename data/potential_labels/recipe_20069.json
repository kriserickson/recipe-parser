    "Remove paper husks from 10 tomatillos; rinse tomatillos. Stem and seed 10 dried chiles de arbol and 2 dried guajillo chiles (or leave seeds, depending on how spicy you want this to be). Warm an ungreased comal (griddle) or large skillet over medium. Add tomatillos; cook 10 minutes, turning them so they cook evenly. Place tomatillos in a blender. Wipe off comal; return to heat. Add all chiles; cook 2 minutes or until lightly toasted and start to smell nutty, stirring constantly. Don't let them brown or blister. Add chiles to blender. Add 4 garlic cloves to comal; cook until lightly browned on all sides. Add to blender with 1 tsp. sea salt. Cover and puree. Add more salt if needed. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 1 week. Makes 2 cups."
