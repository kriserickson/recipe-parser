    "Roast or steam your sweet potato. It will soften up a lot faster if cut into small cubes. Feel free to leave the skin on, but you can also peel it off if it's not your thing.",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Mash sweet potato in a large bowl with a fork, and add turkey, onion, garlic, honey, egg, flaxseed, salt and spices. Mix until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. (Hate to admit it, but using your hands works best!)",
    "Place your mixture in a greased meatloaf pan.",
    "Stick in the oven and bake for about 50-55 minutes. Cover with tinfoil if necessary to avoid burning the top.",
    "Serve with your favorite vegetables, mash, or saute, and as always, these can also be easily made into meatballs...just shape, stick in a muffin tin, and bake for about 25 minutes :)"
