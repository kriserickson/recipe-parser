    "Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line 12 muffin cups with aluminum foil muffin holders.",
    "Peel and core the apples. Cut them into 1/4-inch cubes. Divide the apple cubes among the 12 muffins cups. You can sprinkle them with some additional cinnamon or nutmeg if you desire.",
    "Combine butter (at room temperature), coconut sugar, oats, cinnamon, and almond flour in a bowl. Use a fork to knead the mixture until it's crumbly and can form a ball in your hand.",
    "Now the fun part... prepare to get messy hands! (Please wash them first!) Top each the muffin cups with approximately 2 tablespoons of the crumble, patting down to cover the apples until all the mixture is used... it should cover most if not all of the apple. (This will keep your apples from drying out.) Bake for 20-30 minutes or until apples are soft (use a fork to test them).",
    "Notes: I'm a huge numbers person so each muffin tin gets 1/3 of an apple. I sliced mine into quarters, then sliced each quarter into 4 more slices (making 16 slices per apple). Each tin got 5 slices, which were further chopped into square sized pieces. I ate the leftover slices :)"
