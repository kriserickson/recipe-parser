    "Follow the basic recipe until Step 8, then split the dough into half or quarters.",
    "Roll or push it out to an oval shape roughly 1.5cm thick; don’t fuss around for perfection, it’s supposed to be rough and rustic, so what a great excuse for a beginner!",
    "Place on a baking tray liberally dusted with semolina, and spread evenly with your chosen topping (see tips).",
    "Finally, make those characteristic holes by pushing all your fingers deep into the dough many times, which allows the flavour of the topping to penetrate.",
    "Leave to prove again in a warm place and after about 45 minutes it will prove to that classic 3cm high.",
    "Bake for about 15 minutes at full whack (240°C/475°F/gas 9) until ready. As soon as the focaccia comes out of the oven, feed it with a good drizzle of your very best extra virgin olive oil and a light scattering of sea salt. You can eat the focaccia as soon as it has cooled slightly."
