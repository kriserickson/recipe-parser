    "How to do it",
    "1. In a medium-sized pot, heat the olive oil and saute the onions until they are soft (they will just start to color, don’t brown them). Add the crushed garlic and stir around in the pot for a few seconds until they just start to get some color (do not let them brown otherwise they will burn) Add the tomatoes, herbs, seasoning, sugar and wine.",
    "2. Bring to the boil and then turn the heat down to low and let the sauce simmer uncovered for a few minutes.",
    "3. Meanwhile…in a bowl, whisk the egg, add the spices and ketchup, and mix together. Add the ground beef and mix well until combined. Add the breadcrumbs and mix well. Check to see that you have a consistency that allows you to shape a ball that retains its shape. If the meat mixture is too soft, add some more breadcrumbs, but don’t make the mixture too dry or your meatballs will be dry.",
    "4. Bring the tomato sauce to the boil. Make small golf-ball sized meatballs (I use a heaped tablespoon to give me a consistent amount of meat per ball) and drop them carefully into the sauce. Shake the pot occasionally to ensure the meatballs are all covered with sauce.",
    "5. When all the meatballs are in the pot, turn the heat down low, cover the pot and allow the meatballs to simmer for about an hour.",
    "This makes about 12-15 meatballs. I usually double this recipe.",
    "Serve with spaghetti or rice.",
    "*Fresh breadcrumbs: Slice 2-3 thick slices of day-old+ bread into cubes and put them in the food processor using the large metal blade and process for about 1-2 minutes until you get crumbs. You can store leftovers in the freezer. Using freshly made breadcrumbs keeps the meatballs very moist and and is a good way to use up leftover bread. (Because you aren’t using these to fry with, you don’t have to dry them out in the oven, so it really is a quick process)"
