    "In a 3- or 4-quart pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add broccoli and onion, and cook over medium heat until broccoli is cooked through. Combine the non fat dry milk and water, and stir it into the pot. Add the cheese cubes and stir until the cheese has melted. Add basil, garlic, cayenne and black pepper and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Puree the broccoli cheese soup in small batches until it’s smooth. Or, if you like your soup to be chunky, only puree half of the soup. (See Notes below for more tips.) Add salt to taste. Reheat over low heat if necessary."
