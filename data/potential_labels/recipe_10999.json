    "In a medium sauce pan, combine the oats, Almondmilk Coconutmilk, water and chia seeds. Bring the mixture to a low boil and then simmer over medium low heat, stirring often until the liquid has been absorbed and the oats have thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla + salt. If your oatmeal gets too thick, just thin with more Almondmilk Coconutmilk.",
    "Meanwhile, heat a skillet to medium high heat. Add the coconut oil. Sprinkle both sides of the banana slices with coconut sugar. Once the pan is hot, but not smoking, add the banana slices in a single layer. Cook for 1 minutes per side or until the banana is just caramelized. Carefully remove the bananas from the pan.",
    "Divide the oatmeal among two bowls and top with the warm caramelized bananas. Add the chocolate and a drizzle of honey + any other desired toppings. Drizzle over a little Almondmilk Coconutmilk and EAT!"
