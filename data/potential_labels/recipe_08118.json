    "FOR THE BURGERS: Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a large baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper.",
    "Peel the yam. Using the regular-sized grate hole, grate the yam until you have 1 1/2 lightly packed cups. I used the grater attachment disc in my food processor to save time (it takes less than 20 seconds). Place into large bowl.",
    "Remove grater attachment from food processor, and add the regular \"s\" blade. Mince the garlic, cilantro, and ginger until finely chopped.",
    "Add drained chickpeas and process again until finely chopped, but leave some texture. Scoop this mixture into a large bowl.",
    "In a small bowl, stir together the flax and water mixture.",
    "Grind the oats into a flour using a blender or a food processor. Or you can use 3/4 cup + 1 tablespoon pre-ground oat flour. Stir this into the mixture along with the flax mixture.",
    "Now stir in the oil, aminos/tamari, salt/pepper, and spices until thoroughly combined. Adjust to taste if desired.",
    "Shape 6-8 patties, packing the mixture firmly together. Place on baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, then carefully flip, and bake for another 18-23 minutes until golden and firm. Cool on pan.",
    "FOR THE CILANTRO SAUCE: Mince garlic in a food processor, followed by the cilantro. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients and process until smooth and creamy.",
    "Serve the patties with a generous dollop of sauce and optional homemade salsa (from OSG cookbook, p.95) with a bun or lettuce wrap.",
    "Tips:",
    "Note: I was missing a bit of crunch in these burgers, so next time I think I will add 1/4 cup sunflower seeds into the mix."
