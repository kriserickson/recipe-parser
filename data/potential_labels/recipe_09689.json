    "Add all ingredients to our blender except the cacao nibs. Blend until smooth. Add in the cacao nibs and pulse a couple times to break them up a little, but so you still have chunks. Serve immediately garnished with fresh mint and cacao nibs on top.",
    "To make this more of an “ice cream”, use your food processor instead and add less almond milk, only 1/4 cup or just enough to help it process."
