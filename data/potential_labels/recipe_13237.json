    "Stir sugar and 1 Tbsp. warm water in a small bowl to dissolve sugar. Stir in lime juice, mirin, soy sauce, and vinegar; set dipping sauce aside.",
    "Soften rice noodles according to package instructions. Drain; run under cold water until chilled.",
    "Fill a shallow dish with warm water. Working with 1 rice paper round at a time, dip in water, turning occasionally, until just pliable but not limp, about 20 seconds (replenish with more warm water as needed). Transfer to a cutting board.",
    "Place a ½ lettuce leaf in center of the rice paper. Top with a small handful of rice noodles and a few pieces each of chicken, bell pepper, carrot, cucumber, and avocado. Top with chile, if using, and cilantro and mint. Fold bottom of rice paper over filling, then fold in sides and roll like a burrito into a tight cylinder; cut in half if desired. Place roll, seam side down, on a platter. Repeat to make 11 more rolls. Serve with reserved dipping sauce.",
    "Do Ahead: Rolls can be made 1 hour ahead. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and chill."
