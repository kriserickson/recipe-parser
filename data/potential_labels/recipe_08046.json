    "STEP 1: The night before prepare the marinade for the chicken. Slice the chicken, coat with marinade, and refrigerate until ready to cook. (Full instructions here).",
    "STEP 2: About 45 minutes prior to when you want to eat, begin preparing the quick curried chick peas. (Full instructions here) While the chick peas are simmering, move on to the rice.",
    "STEP 3: Begin to prepare the yellow jasmine rice. (Full instructions here) While the rice is simmering, begin to grill the chicken.",
    "STEP 4: Cook the marinated chicken strips on an indoor grill as described here. If the chickpeas or rice are finished before the chicken has finished cooking, cover them with a lid, turn the heat down to the lowest setting, and keep warm until everything is finished.",

    "You will most likely have left over cilantro from the bunch (the recipe only calls for about a half bunch). Luckily, this herb goes well on top of all three of these dishes! You could use it to make a quick cilantro dressing, or try freezing it. And if the rest of that cilantro does go to waste, you’ll be out about 60 cents… which is a fraction of what you’ve saved by making this meal yourself."
