    "To assemble the dogs spread a little avocado crema on the toasted bun and sprinkle with blue cheese. Add the chicken dogs and top with equal amounts of shredded cheddar cheese. Place on a baking sheet and broil for 1 minute to 30 seconds. Top each dog with the avocado ranch, shredded, lettuce shredded carrots, blue cheese and the remaining buffalo sauce. Eat!"
