    "In the same skillet that you used to sauté the apples, add enough coconut oil or cooking spray to ensure that the skillet is well coated. I used about 1/2 tsp. for each batch.**",
    "Using a scant 1/4 cup measuring cup, drop batter onto skillet and cook until the edges look dry and bubbles begin to form on the tops of the pancakes, about 2 minutes. Using a spatula, flip and cook for about 2 more minutes on the other side. Repeat until all the batter is gone, making sure to coat your skillet again with oil between each batch.",
