    "In a large mixing bowl, mix flours, salt, paprika and cayenne pepper together, and blend well. Cut chicken wings into drumettes and flappers. Wash and drain chicken. Coat chicken in flour mixture; refrigerate chicken wings for 90 minutes. When ready to deep fry chicken wings, heat oil to 375 degrees. Place chicken pieces in hot oil, but do not crowd. Fry chicken wings until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain. When all wings have been fried, place in a large bowl. Add Hot Sauce mixture and mix completely. Use a fork or tongs to place chicken pieces on a serving platter. Serve immediately and with lots of paper towels."
