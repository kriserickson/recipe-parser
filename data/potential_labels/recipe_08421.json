    "Preparation time:50 minutesTotal time:2 hours, 30 minutesMakes:12 adult servings",
    "Ingredients",
    "Carrot cake",
    "2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "2 tsp cinnamon",
    "11/2 tsp baking powder",
    "1 tsp baking soda",
    "1/2 tsp salt",
    "1/4 tsp nutmeg",
    "4 eggs",
    "11/4 cups brown sugar",
    "1 cup canola oil",
    "1 tsp vanilla",
    "5 medium carrots, peeled and grated",
    "Cream cheese icing",
    "3 1/2 cups icing sugar",
    "3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature",
    "1 tbsp lemon juice",
    "1 250-g pkg cream cheese",
    "Directions",
    "Cake",
    "Preheat oven to 350F. Spray two 9-in. round cake pans with oil. Line bottom of pans with parchment.",
    "Stir flour with cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg in a medium bowl until combined.",
    "Whisk eggs with brown sugar, oil and vanilla in a large bowl. Stir in grated carrots. Fold in flour mixture until no streaks remain. Divide batter between prepared pans, smoothing tops.",
    "Bake in centre of oven until a cake tester inserted into centre of cake comes out clean, 25 to 30 min. Let cool 10 min, then turn cakes onto rack and cool completely, about 1 hour.",
    "Set one cake on a platter or cake stand. Spread with 1 cup icing, right to edge. Top with remaining cake. Spread remaining icing on top of cake to the edge.",
    "Decorate with candy carrots (see below for how-to).",
    "Icing",
    "Combine icing sugar with butter and lemon juice in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Beat on low until combined, 1 min. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, 5 min. Add cream cheese and beat on medium-high just until combined, 30 sec.",
    "Candy carrot",
    "Microwave an orange taffy candy until soft, 10 to 12 sec. Roll into a ball and then into a log, tapering one end. Gently press ridges into carrots with the back of a paring knife. Stick a mint stem in the other end.",
    "Tip",
    "Iced cake will keep well in the refrigerator for 3 days. Make candy carrots and decorate cake just before serving, so the mint stays fresh.",
    "Originally published in the Today’s Parent April 2015 issue, this recipe has a triple-tested guarantee from the Chatelaine Kitchen powered by GE."
