    "Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
    "Add everything to a large bowl and mix together with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until combined (or use a hand-held or stand mixer).",
    "Scoop mounds of dough, about ¼ cup each, onto baking sheets. 6 cookies per baking sheet since they are so large. The cookies won’t spread much in the oven, so gently press the mounds down to create a flatter shape.",
    "Bake for 18-21 minutes until lightly browned on the sides.",
    "Remove from the oven and let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "Cookies will stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week."
