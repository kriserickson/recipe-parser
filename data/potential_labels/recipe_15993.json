    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "Prepare large pieces of aluminum foil in a baking pan. Place each sweet potato in its own foil. Top with a drizzle of olive oil and salt. Fold the aluminum foil tightly sealing the sweet potatoes into their own pouches. Roast in the 400 degrees F heated-oven for 1 hour or until very soft (if the flesh busts out of the potato skins, that is a good sign.) Remove from the oven and let cool briefly.",
    "When the sweet potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel and discard some of the skin but not all. Transfer the sweet potatoes to a pot or bowl and mash with a potato masher or fork. Now add the butter, nutmeg, 1/2 the amount of thyme, and the molasses. Stir to combine.",
    "Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with the remaining thyme, walnut halves and a drizzle of molasses. If you like, keep extra molasses and walnuts handy for individualsâ€™ use. Enjoy!"
