    "In a large cast iron skillet like this one, heat 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil on medium high until shimmering but not smoking. Add mushrooms. Cook, tossing regularly, until browned (about 5 minutes). Season with salt, and transfer the mushrooms to a plate until later.",
    "Return skillet to stove-top. Add 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil and heat on medium high. Add Brussels sprouts and onions (if you have to, do this in batches, donâ€™t crowd the pan). Season with garlic powder, cardamom and cinnamon. Cook, turning occasionally, until the sprouts are crisp and golden brown (even charred in some spots). Onions will cook down and caramelize. Season generously with salt.",
    "Return the mushrooms to the pan to warm up (a couple minutes longer).",
    "Turn heat off. Add lemon juice and toss. Taste and adjust seasoning to your liking. Add a finishing drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Toss in the cranberries and hazelnuts.",
    "Transfer to a serving platter. Enjoy!"
