    "Heat a small saucepan over medium low heat. Add the Earth Balance and heat until it is sizzling and boiling quite a bit. Whisk in the flour all at once to make a paste and continue to whisk it constantly for about a minute. Add in a SMALL pinch of turmeric for color and mix well (you want your sauce yellow, but you don’t want it too yellow). Slowly whisk in soy milk. Bring sauce to a boil, whisking frequently. Boil for 2 to 3 minutes and remove from heat. Whisk in the cayenne and nutritional yeast. Add the lemon juice and mix well. Taste for seasoning. I probably ended up adding in about a teaspoon of salt, but I didn’t measure and I really like salt. I just kept adding it until I thought my sauce was sufficiently salty. Season to your taste with salt and a bit of black pepper. Lastly, add the vegenaise for a little bit more creaminess."
