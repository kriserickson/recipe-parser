    "Preheat the oven to 200ºC/180ºC fan/gas mark 6.",
    "Coarsely grate the parsnips, carrots, potatoes and swede (or use a food processor with a grater attachment). Wrap the grated vegetables in a clean tea towel with the sliced onions and squeeze out as much moisture as possible, then season with the dried thyme and salt and pepper and set aside.",
    "Heat 1 tsp of oil in a very large ovenproof frying pan and cook the sausages for 5 minutes until they are browned all over.",
    "Add the vegetables to the pan and stir-fry everything together for 2 minutes, then spread into a single layer around the sausages. Transfer to the oven for 45–50 minutes, until the vegetables are softened and the sausages are cooked through.",
    "Meanwhile, make the kale pesto. Add all the ingredients to a food processor along with 1–2 tbsp water and blitz until smooth, seasoning to taste.",
    "5 minutes before serving, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and cook the eggs to your liking. Serve on top of the rosti and sausages, drizzled with pesto to finish."
