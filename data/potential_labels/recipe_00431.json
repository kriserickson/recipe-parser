Add three fourths of the cheese to the dough, then layer the brussels sprouts on top. Spread the turkey and the bacon all over the pizza, then cover with the remaining cheese. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Remove and drizzle the avocado ranch over top before serving.",
