    "In the jar of a blender, combine the marinade ingredients and puree until smooth. Season to taste with kosher salt. Remove 2 tablespoons of the marinade and transfer it to a small bowl. The rest should go in a large Tupperware or Ziploc bag. Add the shrimp to the marinade, toss to coat and refrigerate for at least an hour and up to all day.",
    "With the remaining two tablespoons of marinade, add the ¼ cup vegetable oil and the red wine vinegar. Mix well and season to taste with kosher salt and set aside.",
    "In a large bowl or on a serving platter, combine the lettuce, fresh corn kernels, bell pepper, black beans and avocado.",
    "Bring a large skillet to highest heat. When the skillet is smoking, add 1/3 of the shrimp. (You do not want to over crowd the pan or the shrimp will steam instead of get browned on the edges). After 1-2 minutes, flip and repeat, cooking the shrimp until they are just barely cooked to opaque in the center, Remove them to a separate plate and continue cooking the rest of the shrimp.",
    "Drizzle the salad with prepared dressing and then pile the shrimp on top. Squeeze the fresh lime over the top of the salad, toss and serve."
