    "Heat the butter in a large frying pan. Tip in the onion, then fry gently for 5 mins until softened. Stir in the rice and mix until coated in the butter, then pour in the wine and let it bubble until itâ€™s almost all disappeared.",
    "Pour in half the stock, give it a good stir, then leave to gently cook for 10 mins. Add half of the remaining stock, stir again and cook for 5 mins more. Keep adding stock and cooking until the rice is tender.",
    "Peel the skin off the mackerel, scrape away any dark brown flesh, then flake. Stir into the rice with the spring onions and spinach, then cook just until the spinach has wilted slightly. Serve straight away."
