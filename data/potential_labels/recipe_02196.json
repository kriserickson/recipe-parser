    "1.To make the scones preheat the oven to 180C (160C fan) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.",
    "2. Place the bacon into a non-stick frying pan and cook until beginning to crisp. Tip out onto a plate and allow to cool, before mixing together with the spring onions and the cheese.",
    "3. Place the flour, baking powder and sugar into a large bowl and mix together to combine. Add the diced flora block and using a pastry blender or two knives cut in the fat until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs - some pieces should be about pea sized. Add the bacon, spring onions and cheese and mix together. In a jug whisk together the milk and the egg.",
    "3. Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in the liquid. Using a knife bring the mixture together. Once a shaggy dough has been formed tip out on a lightly floured work surface and bring together into a uniform dough - donâ€™t work too much or your scones will be tough.",
    "4. Pat the dough into a flat round a couple centimetres thick then use a knife to cut into 8 equal sized pieces. Place onto the prepared baking tray and brush the tops of the scones with a little egg or milk and sprinkle with the dukah. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool for a few minutes before serving. Best served warm on the day baked."
