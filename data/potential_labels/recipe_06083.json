    "Preheat the oven to 400°F Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.",
    "Slice boneless skinless chicken breasts in to ½-inch wide pieces. Place on an aluminum foil-covered baking sheet. Brush each piece with pesto and sprinkle Italian breadcrumbs over the top. Mist with olive oil cooking spray.",
    "Break off the tough ends of the asparagus, and lay the stalks out on a second baking sheet. Mist with olive oil cooking spray, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Place both baking sheets in the oven at the same time, with the chicken on the middle rack and the asparagus on the upper rack. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the asparagus is tender but still crisp.",
