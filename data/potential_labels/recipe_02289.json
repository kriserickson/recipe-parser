    "Set a colander over a large mixing bowl. If the holes are too large and the tomatoes will fall through, line the colander with paper towels. Pour the tomatoes into the colander and allow the juices to drain for at least an hour. If you choose to do this the night before, place the colander and bowl in the refrigerator. Discard the collected juices.",
    "With a fork, mix the cream cheese with the Parmesan, basil and drained tomatoes. Divide the dip between two greased 6-ounce gratin dishes or pour into a shallow 8 to 12 ounce oven-safe dish. Place under the broiler for 10-15 minutes, or until the tops begin to brown. Top with additional basil before serving."
