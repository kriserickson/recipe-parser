    "Heat the olive oil in a saucepan and sizzle the chorizo for 1 min until some of the oil starts to come out. Add the onion and cook for 5 mins until soft, then add the risotto rice and cook for 1 min. Splash in the vinegar, then add the tomatoes and stir well.",
    "Gradually add the hot stock, a ladleful at a time â€“ stir the rice until the stock is absorbed, then add the next ladleful. With the last ladleful of stock, add the peas and keep stirring until the rice is cooked. Turn off the heat and stir through the Parmesan and parsley, if using. Serve straight from the pan, with extra Parmesan, if you like."
