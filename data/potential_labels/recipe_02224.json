    "Make the cinnamon-spiced bread crumbs: In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, brown sugar, cinnamon and melted butter until well combined.",
    "Make the caramelized squash: Preheat the oven to 325°. In a mixing bowl, toss the squash with the sugars, spices, melted butter and salt. Place the squash on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until lightly caramelized and the flesh begins to soften, about 15 minutes. Remove the squash from the oven and let it cool slightly.",
    "Make the squash and bread pudding: Grease a 4-quart baking dish or a 12-inch cast-iron pan; set aside.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar and vanilla until the eggs become pale and slightly frothy. Whisk in the milk, cream, cinnamon, salt, zest and melted butter until mixture is well combined. Add the caramelized squash and torn baguette and gently toss until all the bread pieces are coated. Set aside and allow the bread mixture to soak up the liquid for 15 minutes.",
    "Transfer the bread mixture to the greased baking dish. Cover with foil and bake until the bread pudding has set, about 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake until the top becomes crisp and deep golden-brown, another 25 minutes.",
    "Serve warm with a dollop of whipped cream, topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon-spiced bread crumbs and a drizzle of the sorghum or molasses."
