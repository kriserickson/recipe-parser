    "Heat the oil in the pressure cooker set to the sauté function on high if possible. Add beef, spread it over the bottom of the pot over the oil, and let it brown without stirring for 7 minutes. Give it a good stir and sauté for 1 more minute, then use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a plate. Season meat with 1 teaspoon salt.",
    "Stir in onion, bell pepper, jalapeño, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook until softened, about 5 minutes.",
    "Stir in chili powder, tomato paste, and cumin, cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in beef and any juices from the plate, oregano, tomatoes, beans and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, then cover and cook on high pressure for 8 minutes. Let pressure release naturally.",
    "Stir in cilantro and a squeeze or two of lime juice, then taste and adjust seasonings if necessary. Serve with sour cream, avocado and pickled jalapeño if you like."
