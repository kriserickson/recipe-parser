    "Stir together the flour, baking soda and salt. In another bowl stir together the yogurt, honey and eggs. Combine the wet and dry ingredients until just combined. Get ready for pancake time. (Yes, that’s a real step. Take this serious, yo.)",
    "In a medium/large shallow pan heat butter or oil over low/medium heat until it’s hot and melted (oil won’t really melt, so just wait until it hot). Pour a small amount of batter on the hot pan and see how quickly it cooks, this is a ‘test-pancake.’ I find I need this step as I tend to get overly anxious about pancakes and don’t wait long enough for the pan to heat up. You may not need this step. Know thy self. When the heats just right pour about 1/4 cup batter in the pan, wait until a few bubbles form and pancake is set and use a metal spatula to gently and carefully flip the pancake. Continue to cook until done (2-3 minutes or less). Repeat until you have cooked all the batter.",
    "Serve with a bit more honey, butter or maple syrup."
