    "In a baking dish or ziplock bag, combine the chicken, salt, pepper, paprika, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, olive oil, lime juice and garlic. Marinate for 2 to 24 hours.",
    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.",
    "When ready to cook, heat and oven-safe skillet (I like my cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add the chicken to the skillet and sear on both sides until golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Pour in the beer (or other liquid and add the sliced bell peppers on top. Cover the skillet and place in the oven, roasted the chicken and peppers for 1 hour. After an hour, remove the skillet cover, letting the chicken cool slightly. Shred the chicken with the peppers (I like to do this in my kitchen mixer) and place it in a bowl.",
    "Add 1/2 cup of the salsa verde on a plate. Spray a baking dish with nonstick spray and dip a tortilla into the salsa verde, just so it covers both sides, letting excess run off. Place the tortilla on one side of the baking dish and repeat with another tortilla - placing it next to the first. This begins your two stacks! Cover the first two tortillas with the chicken mixture, add a bit of monterey jack on top. Repeat with another tortilla, dipped in salsa, on both stacks. Add more chicken and cheese - repeating two more times. You want four tortillas stacked, with 3 layers of chicken and cheese. Bake for 25 minutes.",
    "Remove the baking dish and pour the remaining salsa over the stacks. Cover with the onions, cilantro, jalapeños and cotija cheese. Serve immediately!"
