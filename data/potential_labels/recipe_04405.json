    "In a large pan heat the oil, once warm onions, chile and ginger, cook until onion has softened. Next add all of the spices and cook for 3 minutes, stirring often to prevent burning. Next add tomatoes and eggplant and mix until the eggplant has been well coated with the spices.",
    "Cover and simmer under medium low heat until the eggplant has cooked all the way through, is soft and the liquid has evaporated leaving a thick mixture. Taste for salt and spiciness, and adjust to your taste.",
