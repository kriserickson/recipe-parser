    "Cook the quinoa (about 1 cup raw quinoa makes 2 cups cooked, save the rest for another recipe!)",
    "Roast the cashews in a 350 oven for 8 to 10 minutes, checking to make sure they don’t burn.",
    "Slice through the broccoli like you are cutting a head of cabbage, as thinly as you can. Then cut off the longest stems and chop through it to make sure the pieces are small. Steam until bright green, about 1 minute. Drain and run under cold water immediately to stop the cooking.",
    "Thinly slice the scallions and set aside.",
    "Whisk the oil and lemon juice into the bottom of a mixing bowl. Drop in the quinoa, cashews, broccoli and scallions. Mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Enjoy!"
