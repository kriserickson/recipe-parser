    "Season turkey meat with salt, pepper, chili powder and onion powder and mix together well. Make 4 equal patties.",
    "Divide each patty in half so that you can stuff it. On one half of the divided patty, add 2 tablespoon of cheese and 1 tablespoon of chilies. Top with the remaining half of the patty seal with turkey around the edges to close the burger.",
    "Heat a large skillet sprayed with olive oil spray on high heat. Add burgers and reduce the heat to low. Cook on one side until browned, then flip. Flip a few times to prevent burning and make sure burgers are cooked all the way through, about 5 minutes per side.",
    "Serve each patty on a toasted bun and add your favorite toppings, such as avocado, salsa and arugula."
