    "1. Make the rye croutons: Preheat the oven to 350°. Place the torn rye bread onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and toss with the olive oil and ½ teaspoon of salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Bake in the oven until the croutons are lightly toasted, about 20 minutes.",
    "2. Make the dressing: In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the dressing ingredients and refrigerate until ready to use. Makes 1 cup.",
    "3. Make the salad: Prepare an ice bath. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the eggs for 7½ minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs and transfer them to the ice bath to cool. Peel the eggs then cut them into wedges.",
    "4. Assemble the salad: Arrange the red leaf lettuce, romaine hearts and upland cress or watercress onto a platter. Place the jicama, tomatoes, sprouts, ham, chicken, both cheeses, apricots, crackers and eggs on top in individual sections. Season with salt and pepper, and serve with the dressing on the side."
