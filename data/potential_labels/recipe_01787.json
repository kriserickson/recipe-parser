    "1. Roast skin on sweet potatoes for 1 hr on 220 degrees with a drizzle of olive oil. Turn several times during roasting.",
    "2. Remove the skins and mash the soft part of the potato with salt and pepper. Put the skins back on the oven tray. There should still be enough oil on the tray but if it is very dry add another drizzle of olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and put back in the oven on 250 for 15 minutes.",
    "Method 2:",
    "1. Wash and peel potatoes or sweet potatoes. Mix with a little olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and place on an oven tray in the middle of a hot oven.",
    "2. Cook for about 45 minutes at 250 degrees or until the skins are cooked and crispy.",
    "3. Cook the insides of the potatoes however you want. Boil, roast, or use in soups, stews, pies…see my recipes below.",
    "These crisps are delicious with tzatziki dip or just on their own!"
