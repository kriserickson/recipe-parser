    "Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees or for you heathens 176.667 Celsius",
    "Pulse time",
    "So I missed a before photo. Add 3 or more cloves of garlic and 1 & 1/2 Tbls of dried basil or dried oregano to your Cuisinart and pulse it. Don't own a Cuisinart, no problem just use a garlic press.",
    "Butter time.",
    "Add 2 sticks of ROOM TEMP butter (aka 1 cup). I used 1 salted and 1 unsalted to keep the salt lower since we'll be adding mozzarella cheese later. I can't stress enough the butter has to be room temp. Stick the butter in your pockets or have a onlooker hold them to speed up the warm up process if you forgot to pull the butter out of the fridge earlier."
