    "Place a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and add the oil. After it gets hot, add the onion, bell pepper, and celery and cook for about 5 minutes, until they become translucent but not brown.",
    "Add the garlic, chile, tomatoes, bay leaves, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne if using, thyme, oregano, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Let everything cook until some of the tomato juice releases, about 1 minute.",
    "Add the rice and slowly pour in the broth. Lower the heat to medium and let the dish cook until the rice absorbs all the liquid, 20 to 25 minutes. If you’re using any of the additions, throw them in to cook with the rice after 15 minutes have passed.",
    "Taste and adjust the salt, and pepper, and any other spices."
