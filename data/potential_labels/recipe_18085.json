    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Season salmon fillet with salt and pepper and place on a foil lined baking sheet. Roast salmon in oven for 15-20 minutes or until salmon is cooked through.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions. Drain.",
    "Wipe out cooking pot with a paper towel and add the olive oil. Heat oil over medium-low heat. Add garlic and saut√© until soft and fragrant, about 30-60 seconds. Add lemon juice and broth; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, whisk in cream, stirring to combine. Add in cheese and lemon zest; cook about 3 minutes to heat through but do not boil; taste and season with salt. Add pasta to cream mixture and gently mix to evenly coat noodles. Continue to mix until the sauce thickens slightly and clings to pasta. Break the salmon into large chunks and gently stir into the pasta mixture."
