    "Heat oil over high heat. Once the oil is nicely hot add the whole spices (black cardamom, cinnamon, chili, cloves, cumin seeds, coriander and bay leaves).",
    "As the sputter add garlic. Cook for 30 seconds until it turns golden. Add onion.",
    "Turn the heat to medium and cook the onion until it turns golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Stir occasionally.",
    "Add turmeric and salt. Stir. Add goat/lamb chops.",
    "Stir well mixing the meat well with onion. Cover. Turn the heat to medium low and cook until the meat is done.",

    "Some people like the curry a little thin so you can add a little water if you like. We like our mutton do pyaza dry so we cook it in the liquid oozing from the meat itself.",
    "Once done, turn the heat off and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. Garnish and serve hot with naan, roti or any bread of your choice.",
