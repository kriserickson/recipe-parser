    "Combine the brown rice, water, garlic, ginger, and chili. 2. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cook for 35-40 minutes. 3. Meanwhile, steam the kale first in a tiny bit of water, when the water evaporates, add the oil, soy sauce, and chopped garlic. Stir fry until the kale and garlic are tender. Serve either with kale on top of a rice bed, or mix it together! I made this up today, and it makes an awesome and filling (and nutritional) lunch. Serves: 2, Preparation time: 45 minutes"
