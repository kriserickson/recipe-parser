    "To soften yeast, in a large bowl combine the warm water, yeast and sugar. Let stand 5 minutes. Then stir in salt, olive oil, bread flour and 1 cup unbleached flour. Beat well. To make a stiff dough, gradually add 3/4 to 1 cup unbleached flour. Turn out on a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Place in a bowl oiled with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, turning once to oil the top. Cover and let rise until doubled, 30 to 45 minutes. Flatten dough to expel air. Do not knead. You want this dough to be relaxed. Stretch and pat out dough to fit across the bottom and up the sides of an oiled or nonstick 10x15-inch jellyroll pan. Make the sides a little thicker than the bottom. Fill and bake."
