    "Pat dry your tofu & place in a medium mixing bowl. Add 2 Tbsp of oil to the bowl, softly mixing the tofu & oil together until evenly coated. Toss onto an aluminum foil lined baking sheet & bake in your toaster oven at 425 ÂºF for 15 minutes. Drain excess oil.",
    "Heat remaining 1 Tbsp oil in a frying pan on medium high heat. Add sliced onions & stir occasionally until brown.",
    "Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, spinach, salt, & pepper. Returning to the frying pan, add the ponzu, vegetable broth, mirin, & sake to the onions. Add the baked tofu to the frying pan. Stir fry for 2 minutes.",
    "Finally, add the egg mixture into the frying pan, turning down the heat to about medium & let it sit. Don't worry about it coating the pan evenly. You shouldn't cook the eggs for more than 5 minutes as it should still be slightly runny. Serve eggs atop of rice & top the oyakodon with green onions."
