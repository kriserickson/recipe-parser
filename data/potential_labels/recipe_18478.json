    "Pour a little of the hot stock into a bowl, add the saffron, and set aside. Heat the oil in a large frying or paella pan, and fry the onion and garlic until softened. Add the tomatoes, cook for 2 minutes, then add the peeled tiger prawns and squid for 1–2 minutes.",
    "Stir in the rice, saffron liquid, peas, and 21⁄4 cups of stock. Simmer, uncovered, without stirring, over low heat for 12–14 minutes, or until the stock has evaporated and the rice is just tender, adding extra stock if necessary.",
    "Meanwhile, cook the Dublin Bay prawns in 2⁄3 cup of simmering stock for 3–4 minutes, or until cooked through. Transfer to a warm plate with a slotted spoon. Tap the mussels and discard any that do not close. Add the mussels to the stock, cover, and cook over high heat for 2–3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, discarding any that have not opened.",
    "Reserve 8 mussels for garnish. Remove the rest from their shells and stir into the paella. Arrange the reserved mussels and Dublin Bay prawns on top, and garnish with parsley"
