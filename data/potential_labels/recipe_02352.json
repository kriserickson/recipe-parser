    "Gordon Ramsay made these potatoes to go along with his Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb on The F Word, Series One, Episode One.",
    "His commies used a Mandoline Slicer to get uniformly thin slices of potatoes, but used a knife for the onion. You can use a knife or a slicer for both, but try to get the slices as even as possible.",
    "Ingredients:",
    "1 liter chicken stock (roughly 4 1/4 cups, or just over a quart)",
    "1 sprig thyme",
    "2 sprigs rosemary",
    "3 crushed cloves of garlic",
    "2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped",
    "2 large onions, peeled and sliced",
    "4 large Desiree potatoes peeled and finely sliced (on a mandolin if possible)",
    "salt & pepper",
    "olive oil",
    "Directions:",
    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (392 degrees if you have a digital oven)",
    "Bring the chicken stock to a boil and add thyme, rosemary, and crushed garlic cloves. Simmer a few minutes and strain (remember, retain the chicken stock, not the herbs). Set aside.",
    "Add olive oil to a hot heavy pan and saute the onions and finely chopped garlic until softened and lightly colored.",
    "Coat the inside of a casserole dish or oven safe pan and layer the onions followed by the potatoes. Continue alternating potatoes and onions until finished. Don’t forget to season each layer with salt & pepper as you go.",
    "Pour the chicken stock from earlier over the potato mixture until it’s about 2/3rds full. Press down on the mixture to help the potatoes absorb as much stock as possible. Drizzle a little olive oil on top.",
    "Bake in the oven for approximately 20 – 25 minutes or until soft and golden on top.",
