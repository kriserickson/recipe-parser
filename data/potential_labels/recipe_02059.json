    "To make the burgers add the ground lamb, cilantro or parsley, garlic, lemon zest, harissa , cinnamon and pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl. Mix until just combined and then form the meat into 4 equal size patties (or 8 smaller patties). Place on a plate and put in the fridge until ready to cook.",
    "To make the chutney. Add a drizzle of olive oil to a medium size skillet. Once hot, add the red onion and cook about 2-3 minutes or until the onion is soft. Add the apricots, red pepper and jalapeño, cook about 3-5 minutes or until the apricots have broken down and softened. Reduce the heat to low and add the apple cider vinegar, honey, cayenne and pinch of salt and pepper. Simmer the mixture until most of the liquid has evaporated, but is still pourable, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cilantro. Allow to cool and then transfer to a glass jar. Store in the fridge (I like to warm this before I put it over my burgers).",
    "To make the pesto add the feta, olive oil, cilantro or mint, pistachios, crushed red pepper and a pinch of pepper to a bowl. Toss well and let sit for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to mend together.",
    "Meanwhile heat your grill or a grill pan to high heat. Grill the burgers for 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium rare or longer for your desired doneness.",
    "Divide the burgers among the naan or pita. Spread the chutney over the burgers and top with feta pesto. Sandwich together and happy eating!"
