    "Heat the oil in a casserole and fry the chicken joints, turning every now and then until golden brown on all sides. Remove the chicken and set aside. Add the onion, ham, garlic and peppers to the pan and cook until softened for about 10 minutes.",
    "Return the chicken to the pan, add the tomatoes and spices, a little salt and pepper, turn up the heat and bring to a simmer.",
    "Reduce the heat, cover loosely with the lid and cook slowly for 45-50 minutes until the chicken is completely cooked and the juices run clear when a skewer is inserted. If the sauce starts to reduce too much add a little water. Adjust the seasoning if necessary before serving."
