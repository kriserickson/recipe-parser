    "Combine all ingredients (except boullion) in a large soup pot. Add the boullion when the mixture begins to heat up so that the boullion comes off the spoon and into the pot easily.",
    "Cover the pot. Allow the soup to gently boil for about 45 minutes until all ingredients are very soft.",
    "Remove the soup from heat and puree it in a food processor or blender. Place the soup back into the pot and keep warm until serving. Enjoy!"
