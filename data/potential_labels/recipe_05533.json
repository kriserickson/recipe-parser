    "Wash the lentils in several changes of water, or place in a sieve and shake under a running tap until water runs clear.",
    "Pour 1/2 cup of the coconut milk and 1.75 cups water into a medium sized pan. Add the lentils, bring to the boil, cover and simmer for 10 – 15 minutes. The lentils should be almost cooked at this stage.",
    "Add the cucumber, chillies and salt. Cook over low heat for 5 – 10 minutes until the cucumber is tender.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the ghee in a separate pan and add the black mustard seeds and curry leaves. Pop the mustard seeds and then empty the contents of the pan into the lentils and cucumber.",
    "Add the remainder of the coconut milk, stir through and cook on a higher heat for 3 – 5 minutes until the sauce thickens."
