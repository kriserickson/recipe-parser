    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "In a large, ovenproof skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Add pears and onions and thyme, and let cook for 8 minutes, or until softened. Season with salt and pepper. Remove to a plate.",
    "In same skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Season pork chops generously with salt and pepper. Sear pork chops for 3 minutes per side, or until a golden crust forms. Pour in chicken broth, cider, and pear-onion mixture and place pan in oven. Cook for another 10 minutes, or until pork chops reach 145 degree F internal temperature. (Depending on thickness of pork chops, this could take up to 15 minutes.)",
    "Let rest for 5 minutes and serve, garnished with remaining thyme leaves.",
    "*Use whatever liquid you have on handâ€“if you just have chicken broth, use that. Or you can use all apple cider. Or use red or white wine. This will just create a nice pan sauce, along with the pears and onions."
