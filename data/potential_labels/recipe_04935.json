    "Gently press the block of tofu after wrapping it in paper towels. You'll see a lot of water coming out, but make sure you don't press too hard as you don't want it to crumble. Once most of the moisture has been pressed out, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes. Set aside.",
    "Mix all the rest of the ingredients, except for the oil, in a glass bowl. Submerge the tofu pieces in the marinade and park it in the fridge for at least 24 hours to up to 48 hours (like I did). Give it a shake every now and then.",
    "Heat a big skillet and pour enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan. On medium heat add the pieces of tofu in a single layer. Be careful, it is going to splatter like crazy!! Using tongs GENTLY turn them around and fry them on all sides. Once they are nicely browned on all sides, drain them on a paper towel.",
    "You could have the tofu as it is, or you could use it with your favorite stir fry, on salads, in wraps or sandwiches. Enjoy!"
