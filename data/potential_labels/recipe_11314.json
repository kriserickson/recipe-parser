    "Preheat the oven at 200⁰C",
    "Wash and rinse the Potatoes. Do not remove the skin as this will help keep the “flower” intact.",
    "Cut the potatoes down the middle, but not all the way down, so that it looks like you have 6 wedges still attached at the bottom.",
    "Now comes the fiddly bit. Gently pull aside the “petals” so that they can sit back without sticking to each other. It’s easier to use the flat side of the knife to gently push them open.",
    "Lay each potato on a tray and drizzle a teaspoon of Vegetable oil on the inside of the “flower”.",
    "Mix the spices, salt and herbs together in a small bowl. Sprinkle the mixture over the “flower”.",
    "Place in the oven for 30/45 minutes or until they have browned.",
    "Serve and enjoy.",
    "OPTIONAL: In a small bowl mix together some cooking cream, teaspoon of mustard, spinach and grated cheese (cheddar; Edam or mozzarella). Depending on the size of the Potato, add some of the mixture to the centre of the “flower”. Leave in the oven for a few minutes before serving."
