    "Whisk together all the ingredients for the dressing. Set aside.",
    "Cook soba noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cool water. Toss noodles with dressing and add the celery, bell pepper, carrots, cabbage, and jalapeño slices. Taste for salt and pepper and season accordingly.",
    "Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Score the mushrooms on both sides with a knife to make an X (do not go in too deep, just a light cut with your knife will do the trick). Brush the mushroom rounds with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Once the pan is hot, add the mushrooms in one layer into the pan (don't overcrowd the pan). Sear on one side until golden brown, about 4 minutes, then flip and do the same on the other side. Remove from pan and place on a paper towel-lined plate.",
    "To serve, portion the noodle salad into bowls. Top with cilantro leaves and sesame seeds and a couple of the mushroom scallops. Serve with lime wedges. Enjoy!"
