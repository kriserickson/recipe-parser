    "ROASTED GARLIC:",
    "Preheat oven to 400F (205 C). Take a head of garlic and slice ½ inch (1.5 cm) of the top. Place garlic head in the center of a piece of foil and pour 2 tbsp olive oil on top. Wrap in foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until soft. Cloves should easily come out from the skins.",
