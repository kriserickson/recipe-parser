    "Start by pulling the white and dark meat away from the bones. Place the shredded chicken in a bowl, cover and refrigerate until later.",
    "In a large stock pot with the heat on medium-high, add in the chicken carcass and brown for 8 minutes or so.",
    "Then throw in the roughly chopped carrot, celery, onion, parsley, thyme, bay leaf and peppercorns. Pour in 12 cups of filtered water and scrape up any browned bits that are on the bottom of the pot. Cover and bring up to a simmer {not a boil} with the lid on, for one hour and thirty minutes.",
    "After the hour and a half is up; drain the stock through a strainer into another large pot or Dutch oven. Discard the remaining bones/vegetables.",
    "Bring the stock back up to a simmer and add in the two diced carrots, celery and onions. Add in the teaspoon of kosher salt, the half teaspoon of black pepper and the chopped thyme. Let simmer until the vegetables are tender.",
    "Meanwhile bring a smaller pot of water to boil. Season with sea salt and drop in the noodles. Cook according to package directions. Drain and then add into soup along with the shredded chicken and stock concentrate.",
    "Stir and simmer until chicken is warmed through.",
    "Serve with oyster crackers and more black pepper if desired."
