    "Cut in the butter with a pastry blender until pea size pieces.",
    "Add the cold buttermilk all at once and form into a ball.",
    "Roll dough onto a lightly floured surface, into a 6x9-inch rectangle. Cut the rectangle into thirds.",
    "Stack each third on top of one another and roll the dough into a 6×9-inch rectangle again.",
    "Using a 2¼ or 2½-inch biscuit cutter, cut 9 (maybe 10) biscuits and place them on a silicone lined baking sheet. Do your best to piece together the scraps and use up all the dough with the layering technique, without overworking the dough or melting the butter with your warm hands. (If any of the edges kind of stick down, I stretch them before baking to help make sure they will grow tall and flaky.)",
    "Bake at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown on top and bottom."
