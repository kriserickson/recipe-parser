    "Instructions",
    "This recipe will work with a 9\" pie plate, a 9\" springform pan, and a 9x9 square pan.",
    "Place Oreo cookies in food processor (do not remove the cream filling) and pulverize until only fine crumbs remain. If you do not have a food processor, place cookies in a Ziploc bag (let all of the air out before sealing) and beat with a rolling pin or mallet until only fine crumbs remain.",
    "In a separate, medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, heat butter until completely melted.",
    "Pour cookie crumbs into the melted butter and stir until well-combined.",
    "Pour cookie crumbs into prepared pan and use your hands and/or the clean bottom of a glass or measuring cup to tamp crumbs tightly into the bottom and sides of your pan.",
    "If the recipe is to be baked -- bake according to your recipe's instructions. For cheesecakes, this crust does notÂ need to be pre-baked unless your recipe specifically instructs so.",
    "If this crust is for a no-bake recipe, refrigerate or freeze for 10-20 minutes before filling.",
    "If you wish to pre-bake this crust (for a crunchier crust), bake on 350F (175C) for 8-10 minutes and then allow it to cool completely before filling."
