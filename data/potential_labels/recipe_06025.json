    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients and keep aside. In another bowl, mix the almond milk, flax meal, yogurt and vinegar and let sit for 2 minutes. Add the rest of the wet ingredients and mix well until the sugar is combined.",
    "Add the wet to the dry and and mix till just about combined. Do not let the mixture sit too long at this point as it keeps thickening. Toss the blueberries in 1 tbsp oat flour to coat and then add to batter. Add the chocolate chips. Fold in to just combine. Spoon the batter into lined or greased muffin pan.",
    "Bake for 21 to 22 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean. (frozen berries will need a minute or 2 longer - 22 to 23 minutes). Remove the muffins from the pan, cover with parchment or towel while they cool for 10 minutes. Serve."
