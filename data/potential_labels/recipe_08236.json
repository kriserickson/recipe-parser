    "Instructions",
    "1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "2. Cut the sweet potatoes into matchsticks, being careful to cut into evenly sized pieces. The thinner you slice the potatoes the faster they will cook.",
    "3. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and ½ teaspoon salt, tossing to coat. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan. If the potatoes are overlapping use a second pan.",
    "4. Bake the sweet potatoes for 20-30 minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove from the oven when the potatoes are lightly browned and tender all the way through. They may not be super crispy, but as long as they're tender and browned they'll be perfect in this recipe.",
    "5. While the potatoes cook, heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, the onion, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Saute for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft.",
    "6. Turn the heat to medium high, add the turkey, ¼ teaspoon salt, cumin, garlic powder, and chili powder. Saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until turkey is browned and cooked through.",
    "7. To serve, place sweet potatoes on a plate. Top with lettuce, the cooked turkey mixture, tomato, guacamole or avocado, and scallions.",
    "Serves 4."
