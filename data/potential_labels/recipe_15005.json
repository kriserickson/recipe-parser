    "2 Prepare your grill for high, direct heat.",
    "3 Coat quartered radicchio with olive oil and sprinkle with salt.",
    "4 Grill the radicchio over high heat, uncovered. Keep an eye on them, as they blacken quickly. You want a little blackening, but not a cinder. When theyâ€™re done, move to a bowl and bring inside to chop.",

    "Serve hot or at room temperature, garnished with grated pecorino or parmesan cheese."
