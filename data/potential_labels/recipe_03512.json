    "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Place the chicken thigh fillets between 2 pieces of cling film and bash with a rolling pin to about 1cm thick. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.",
    "Put the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs on 3 separate plates. Season the flour, then toss the chicken pieces in it to coat, followed by the egg and finishing with a coating of breadcrumbs.",
    "Put the breadcrumbed chicken on a baking sheet and cook for 10-12 mins.",
    "Meanwhile, in a small pan, melt the butter, then stir in the garlic and cook for 3-4 mins until it is softened. Turn down the heat, whisk in the crème fraîche and most of the parsley and season to taste. Serve the sauce in a small pot on the side, to dip into, sprinkle the remaining parsley over the sauce, and serve with salad leaves and skinny fries, if you like."
