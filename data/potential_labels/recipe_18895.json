    "Place all ingredients in bread machine in the order listed by your bread machine. (In mine, that's liquids first, dry ingredients, adding yeast last). NOTE: Do not put this recipe on delay bake due to the yogurt included in the recipe. Can be baked on white bread settings or if your machine has it, french bread settings. If you choose to bake in the oven, bake at 375ÂºF for roughly 40 minutes."
