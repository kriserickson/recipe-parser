    "Place potatoes in a large pot and add enough water to cover them about 1 1/2 inches",
    "Bring water to a boil and add 1 tsp salt. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking for about 30 minutes, until potatoes are soft (we recommend checking after 20 minutes).",
    "In the meantime, prepare the tahini sauce. Place tahini in a medium bowl. Add 1/2 tsp salt and ice water, 1/4 cup at a time, whisking very well after each addition (the tahini will thicken after the first addition, but it will loosen up when you add more water).",
    "When the potatoes are soft and still warm, mash them slightly. Add tahini, 1/2 tsp salt (optional, to taste) and whisk until creamy.",
    "Whisk in parsley and/or sesame seeds."
