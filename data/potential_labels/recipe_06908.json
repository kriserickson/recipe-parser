    "For homemade chips, boil some potatoes, slice them up and shallow fry them in a few tablespoons of olive oil until they are heated through and crispy on the outside",
    "Peel and grate one apple",
    "In a bowl, mix the peeled grated apple with 500g of lean mince beef and a teaspoon of Marmite",
    "Shape and firmly press the mixture into around 10 burgers - squeeze the mixture together so the burgers don't fall apart during cooking",
    "Brush both sides with oil and grill, barbecue or fry until cooked through... about 10 minutes each side",
    "Serve with a bun and salad or with baked beans, broccoli and chips",
    "Why not try...",
    "Adding Worcestershire sauce, sauteed onions or even a crumbled up stock cube to add more flavours to your burgers",
    "You can use any sort of mince for thisÂ recipe, try turkey mince for healthier burgers - if you have a food processor you can even buy beef steaks and mince them yourself"
