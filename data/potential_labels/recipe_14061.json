    "METHOD",
    "Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and fry for a few minutes to soften and lightly brown it. Add the two meats and stir-fry for 6–8 minutes until brown. Add the wine and let the alcohol evaporate for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and the tomato paste. Stir and cook slowly, uncovered, for 11/2 hours. Stir from time to time in case it sticks. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Cook the fresh pasta in plenty of boiling salted water for 4–5 minutes or until al dente. (Dried will take a little longer.) Drain and toss with some of the sauce to coat. Serve on hot plates with a further spoonful of the sauce and some grated Parmesan sprinkled on top."
