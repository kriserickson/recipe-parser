    "Pour the baked beans into the bottom of a 1.5 litre casserole dish. Place the corned beef on top of the beans in an even layer. Season with a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Top with the mash.",
    "Bake uncovered for 25 minutes in the preheated oven. The mash should start to crisp, but not yet brown. Top with the cheese and return to the oven. Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes or until cheese is browned."
