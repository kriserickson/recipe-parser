    "Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until just translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the sausage meat and cook, stirring and breaking it up with a spoon, until it’s browned, about 10 minutes.",
    "Spoon out and discard the excess fat, leaving 1-2 tablespoons in the pan. Stir in the oregano and garlic and cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes more.",
    "Stir in the Roasted Tomatillo Salsa, the hominy along with all of its liquid, the cilantro, and the pumpkin. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer, covered, until the pumpkin cubes are tender, 15-20 minutes. Taste and season with salt, if necessary. Serve right away."
