    "Put the water in the pan in which you want to cook your porridge. And the spices and bay leaf and bring to a simmer. Stir in the coconut milk and add the salt.",
    "Add the porridge oats to the fragrant spiced liquid, bring to the boil and then turn down the heat to a gentle simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring often. Personally, I don’t like porridge too stiff, I like to make sure it can still move around the pan adding more coconut milk or water if necessary.",
    "Spoon your porridge into bowls and add whatever takes your fancy. I like my porridge sweet so add a bit of condensed milk."
