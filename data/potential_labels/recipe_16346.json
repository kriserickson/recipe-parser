Place on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, brush with marinade, and roast at 350°F for 2 1/2 hours, until pork registers 165°F at its thickest point. Tent the roast with foil and allow to rest for 30 minutes, or refrigerate until ready to use.",

    "Butter the inside of the pan Cubano, cut into 4 pieces, and toast butter-side-down in a hot plancha. Slice pork about 1/4-inch thick. In a lightly oiled nonstick pan, sear pork and ham. Fill sandwiches with pork, ham, cheese, and pickles - smear with mustard, smear top exterior of the pan Cubano with butter, and press in the plancha for 2-3 minutes, until bread is deeply browned and cheese is melted. Cut diagonally and serve."
