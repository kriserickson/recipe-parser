    "Whisk your gravy mix and soy milk in a small pot over medium-high heat. Cook until thickened. Make sure you are stirring it while cooking, it should only take a couple of minutes to thicken up. The nice thing about rice flour is that it doesn't clump up though so you can be a little more careless with the whisking!"
