    "Combine all ingredients except chocolate chips into a microwave safe mug. This is a small cake so you can use an 8 oz mug and it should just reach the top when finished cooking. You can also use an oversized mug, but the cake will be lower in the mug. Mix with a small, sturdy whisk until a smooth batter forms and no lumps remain.",
    "Stir in half of the chocolate chips. Sprinkle remaining half over surface. Cook in microwave for about 1 minute. Let cool a few minutes before eating."
