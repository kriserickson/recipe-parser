    "Pour batter into a microwave-safe mug. Mine was a 14-ounce mug. You want enough head space for the cake to rise without pouring over.",
    "Add hazelnut chocolate spread in the middle of the batter or mini chocolate chips. Just drop it in the middle, no need to push it down and sink it in the batter. It does that on its own when it cooks! :)",
    "Place a paper towel into the microwave and set the mug on top (this is to catch any batter if your mug cake overflows).",
    "Microwave mug cake for 70 seconds on high (PLEASE READ NOTES CAREFULLY BELOW)",
    "Carefully remove from microwave and enjoy!"
