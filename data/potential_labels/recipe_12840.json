  "ingredients": [
    "0",
    "1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast",
    "¼ cup flour (almond flour or whole grain gluten-free preferred. I used my “thrown together GF blend” – see notes. Use coconut flour or tiger nut flour for AIP.)",
    "¾ tsp salt (I recommend Real Salt. Add a tad more if using coconut flour if desired.)",
    "1 tsp garlic powder (See Easy Homemade Garlic Powder)",
    "1 tsp paprika (use onion powder for AIP)",
    "⅛ tsp cayenne pepper (optional - omit for AIP)",
    "⅛ tsp black pepper (omit for AIP)",
    "avocado oil (or other fat suitable for high heat. Use amount desired. About ¼ cup should be enough.)"
