    "In a mixing bowl combine rolled oats, raisins, butter, brown sugar, salt and cinnamon. Stir in scalded milk to dissolve butter and sugar. Let cool down to warm. Meanwhile, soften yeast in warm water with 1/4 tsp. sugar. Allow yeast to proof. When milk mixture has cooled down to warm, stir in yeast mixture, egg and 1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour. Beat for 3 minutes. Add 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Add 2 Tbsp. flour in same manner. Spread dough in a well-greased 9x5-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes. Brush top of loaf with melted butter and sprinkle rolled oats over the top. Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Makes one loaf."
