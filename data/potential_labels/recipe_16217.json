    "Bring wine, garlic, oregano, salt, red pepper flakes, and ¼ cup water to a boil in a large skillet. Add kale, cover pan (a baking sheet works great if you don’t have a big lid), and cook, stirring occasionally, until greens are wilted, about 4 minutes. Mix in beans and ½ cup oil and cook, uncovered, until beans are warmed through, about 2 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in another large skillet over medium. Fry bread in skillet until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. (If you don’t have 2 large skillets, cook the bread first and keep it warm in a low oven while you use the same skillet to make the kale and beans.)",
    "To serve, place fried bread on plates and spoon kale mixture and sauce over, dividing evenly. Drizzle with a little oil and vinegar.Read More: The 29 New Essential Recipes from the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen"
