    "Add all the slow cooked pork belly ingredients to a pan (not the glaze ingredients) I use a cast iron casserole pan like this <--affiliate link. Bring to the boil, then place a lid on, turn down the heat and simmer for 2 hours.",
    "Turn off the heat and drain the pork. You can reserve the liquid if you like (Perfect for a Thai or Chinese noodle soup).",
    "Chop the pork into bite sized chunks. Add 1 tbsp. of oil in a frying pan, and then mix the remaining glaze ingredients in a small bowl. Heat the oil and add in the pork, salt and pepper, frying on a high heat until the pork starts to turn golden. Now pour the glaze over the pork and continue to cook until the pork looks dark and sticky. Remove from the heat and serve with some rice and green veg."
