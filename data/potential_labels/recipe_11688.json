    "Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a medium or large saucepan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for 8-10 minutes, until golden brown.",
    "Add the garlic and wine - let the mixture simmer gently to reduce the wine, stirring occasionally. After 15-20 minutes, add the cornstarch, cream, and salt to the marsala mixture - it should start to thicken slightly.",
    "Pound the chicken breasts until they are about 1 inch thick to help with even cooking. Cut them into smaller, single-serving pieces if necessary.",
    "Combine the flour, seasoning, and salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Toss the chicken in the flour mixture until coated. Shake off excess.",
    "Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Pan-fry the coated chicken for a few minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through.",
    "Add sauce and mushrooms to the skillet with the chicken. Top with tomatoes and simmer until the tomatoes have softened. Serve with fresh parsley."
