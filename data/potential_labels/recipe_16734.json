    "Pour in the chicken broth and reduce the heat to a simmer. Top the pot with the cover just slightly askew and cook low and slow for 3 hours. Check it every now and then after a couple hours. If you need to add a bit more chicken broth, you can do so.",
    "When the chicken is super fork tender, remove it from the heat and cool it slightly. Use a couple forks to shred it.",
