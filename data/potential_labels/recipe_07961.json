    "Core the cabbage. Bring a large pot of salted water, 4 to 5 quarts, to a rapid boil. Add the cabbage and blanch it for 15 minutes, turning often or until leaves are softened.",
    "Remove the cabbage from the pot and cool under cold water. Gently separate leaves. Carefully cut out the center vein from 8 of the largest leaves and set the leaves aside.",
    "To make the filing, in a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the beef and cook for 10 minutes or until well browned and all liquid has evaporated.",
    "Remove from the heat and add salt, black pepper, paprika, dried parsley and egg. Mix well to combine.",
    "Place about 1/3 cup of beef mixture in the center of the cabbage. Fold bottom half of cabbage over filling, then fold in sides and roll up tightly.",
    "Place the cabbage rolls side by side in rows, seam-side down, in a Dutch oven or slow cooker. The cabbage rolls should be tightly packed in a single layer.",
    "To make the sauce, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the tomato sauce, bay leaf and chicken soup and cook for 5 minutes. Season to taste.",
    "Pour the mixture over the cabbage rolls. Cover with a lid and cook for 2 hours on high or 4 hours on low.",
    "Remove lid and serve warm."
