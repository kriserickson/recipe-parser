    "Cut your baguette into slices. Lightly spread butter on each slice, and toast until it’s as dark as you like. I baked my slices in the oven at 350 degrees F, for about 10 minutes. Let the bread cool for a few minutes. My burned fingers are a lesson as to how important this is.",
    "While it’s cooling, break the chocolate into large chunks, microwave in 15 second intervals until it’s nice and melty. Spread mascarpone onto the bread, drizzle with chocolate, and lightly top with sea salt."
