    "In a shallow pan, add the 3 ingredients for the sauce. Stir to combine.",
    "Press the tofu between towels to remove excess moisture. Cut into about 1 inch cubes.",
    "Add to the sauce and gently toss until thoroughly coated. Cover and place in fridge to marinate for at least 30 minutes.",
    "Cook rice according to package directions. Meanwhile, slice green onions.",
    "In a skillet, heat 1-2 Tbsp. oil over medium heat.",
    "Add the marinated tofu and spread out in a single layer. Cook without stirring for 5 minutes or until browned on one side. Flip them, and cook for another few minutes.",
    "Add the green onions for the last minute or two of cooking. Sometimes I add a little more hoisin if it dries out too much.",
    "Serve over a hot bed of rice (or quinoa).",
    "*Note: if you'd like to reduce the sodium content, replace 1 Tbsp. of the soy sauce with vegetable broth or water."
