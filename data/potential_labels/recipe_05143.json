    "Preheat oven to 350ºF and grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.",

    "Mix in milk and vanilla.",
    "In a medium bowl, combine salt, baking soda, flour, and oats.",
    "Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, ½ cup at a time.",
    "Press ⅔ of the cookie dough into the prepared pan.",
    "Transfer the Dulce de Leche to a medium, microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for 60 seconds, stirring every 15 seconds.",
    "Spread the Dulce de Leche over the cookie dough in the pan. Top with spoonfuls of the remaining cookie dough. {There won't be enough dough to cover the entire pan, but after it's cooked, it will look nice and pretty with the Dulce de Leche peeking through.}",
    "Bake for 25 minutes, checking at about the 20 minute mark. If it's getting to browned by then, place some aluminum foil over the top of it.",
    "Let cool completely before serving, to let the insides firm up. {It tastes better completely cooled, too. The Dulce de Leche is a lot sweeter.}"
