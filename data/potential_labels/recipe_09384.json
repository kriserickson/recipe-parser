    "Put garlic cloves with the skin still on in a nonstick skillet and heat over medium low heat. Roasting the garlic will take approximately 40 minutes. Rotate the cloves every 10-15 minutes so that they are roasted on all sides. Set aside to cool.",
    "When garlic is cool enough to handle, peel the skins off the cloves. If using whole Hatch chiles, skin the peppers, remove the stem, and remove the seeds. Chop the peppers.",
    "Add the garbanzo beans, garlic, lime juice, salt, tahini, olive oil, and chiles to food processor. Put the lid on and process until you reach your desired consistency, approximately 10-15 seconds. If the mixture is too thick, add water 1 Tbsp at a time and process briefly to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning to your liking.",
    "When complete, use a spatula to put the hummus in a bowl. Top with additional chiles, paprika, or queso fresco if desired. Refrigerate for one hour and serve chilled with pita bread or assorted vegetables."
