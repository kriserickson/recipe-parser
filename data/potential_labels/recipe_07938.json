    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees.",
    "Cut the long end of the butternut squash off of the bulb. I only used the long end because the bulb is so tough to deal with because of it's shape, but feel free to use it.",
    "Remove skin from the butternut squash then chop squash into 1 inch cubes. Place cubes into a bowl along with half of the ¼ cup of coconut sugar (meaning 2 tablespoons), cinnamon and a pinch of salt. Mix the sugar with the squash to well coat.",
    "Cut bacon in half (not lengthwise) to create about 3-4 inch slices of bacon. Wrap each slice of bacon around a cube of coated butternut squash, placing the end of the bacon underneath the squash cube so it doesn't unravel when you bake them. Repeat with all cubes.",
    "Place bacon wrapped cubes on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Sprinkle the rest of the coconut sugar (2 tablespoons) on top of the bacon wrapped cubes.",
    "Place in oven and bake for 30 minutes. Check at about 20 minutes to make sure they are not burning, this will just depend on the thickness of your bacon.",
    "Place a toothpick through the bacon wrapped cubes and eat up!"
