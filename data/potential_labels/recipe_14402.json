    "Separate the dough into four rectangles. Firmly press perforations to seal. Layer two rectangles on top of one another and fold in half to make a tall stack. Repeat this process to for the doughnuts. Cut a small hole in the center of each stack to create the doughnut hole. (You can use the centers to make smaller doughnuts.) In a hot frying pan with oil fry the doughnuts until golden brown on the underside. Flip and brown the other side. Using a slotted spoon remove the doughnuts and drain on paper towels. Place sugar into a paper bag. Add warm doughnuts and shake to coat. Remove and allow the doughnuts to cool before serving."
