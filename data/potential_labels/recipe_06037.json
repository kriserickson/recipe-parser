    "If using dried berries, place in a 1L Fido jar with cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Pour boiling water over berries until just covered. Cover and let set until cooled to room temperature. If using fresh berries, just place berries in jar with the spices.",
    "Once berries are cooled, pour honey over everything and fill until jar is about 75% full.",
    "Seal jar and place in a warm and dark location.",
    "Burp jar once a day. After burping, give the jar a turn to re-coat the berries (be sure to do this AFTER burping the jar to avoid getting sprayed).",
    "Fruit is ready to start eating in about a week but it does get better with time. I try to wait a month at least.",
    "Store at room temperature in a dark location. Will keep for a long time, at least a year, probably much more."
