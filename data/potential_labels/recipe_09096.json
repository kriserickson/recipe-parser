    "Heat your grill or skillet on medium heat and add a little Kerry Gold Butter.",
    "In a large bowl, mix together the beef, salt, pepper, oregano and ketchup.",
    "Divide the mixture into 6 sections, and roll each piece into a ball then press down flat for 6 burgers. You can also use a burger press if you have one.",
    "Place each burger on your grill/pan and cook for approximately 3-4 minutes on each side. Try not to press down on the burgers…they end up a little dry that way.",
    "Once you flip the burger, add your cheese to the top cooked side.",
    "In a small bowl mix together the spread ingredients and refrigerate.",
    "Once you have cooked all your burgers and removed them from the pan, assemble them.",
    "Place 1 cheeseburger on the lettuce leaf, top with 2 slices of tomato, a spoonful of spread, then wrap top to bottom with another lettuce leaf.",
    "So, that’s it! Super simple and easy!",
