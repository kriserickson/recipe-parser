    "To a large pot, add the oil, onion, and garlic. Stir to combine. Increase the heat to medium and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, until the onion is softened.",
    "Add the squash and sweet potato and stir to combine. Add a pinch of salt and continue sautéing for a few minutes longer.",
    "Add the broth, diced tomatoes (with juices), coconut milk, lentils, tomato paste, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper. (If you are spice-shy, feel free to add half the amount to start and increase from there after cooking, to taste.) Stir well to combine.",
    "Increase heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, stir again, and simmer uncovered for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the squash and potato are fork-tender. Reduce the heat if necessary.",
    "Add the apple cider vinegar to taste. Adjust the other seasonings if desired.",
    "Optional step: Using a handheld immersion blender, blend the stew for only 2 to 3 seconds (any more and you’ll blend too much of the veggies). This thickens the broth.",
    "Stir in the chard, and cook for another couple minutes until the greens are wilted.",
    "Scoop some cooked rice onto the bottom of a bowl and then ladle the stew overtop. Garnish with minced cilantro or parsley and a good dusting of garlic and chili powder, if desired.",
    "Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days, and they freeze beautifully too."
