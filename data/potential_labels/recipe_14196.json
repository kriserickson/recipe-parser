    "Roast, or char, the garlic cloves for about 6 to 8 minutes either on the same skillet or comal, or under a broiler for 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside and peel away the husks once the cloves have cooled.",
    "Place the toasted chiles in a medium saucepan and cover with the boiling water, beer and orange juice. Add the prunes to the pan and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes. Put the chiles, prunes and cooking liquid into a blender, along with the garlic and salt. Puree until smooth and serve."
