    "Preheat the oven to 325°F, and lightly coat 8 muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray.",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the coconut oil or butter, egg, and vanilla. Stir in the mashed banana, honey, and yogurt, mixing thoroughly until no large lumps of yogurt remain. Add in the flour mixture, stirring just until incorporated. Fold in the strawberries.",
    "Divide the batter between the prepared muffin cups. Baked at 325°F for 22-24 minutes, or until barely firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack."
