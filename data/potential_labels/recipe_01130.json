    "Combine all ingredients. Mix them together with your hands to form a ball of dough. Add more flour if you need to, just enough so they’re not too sticky.",
    "Knead for about a minute until the dough is smooth. Put in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to a few days.",
    "Divide into 4 balls and using a rolling pin, roll them into flat disks.",
    "Heat a skillet and add butter or oil, and then the raw flatbreads. Cook for a minute or two on each side like you would cook a pancake. Flip when you start to see bubbles, and remove when they’re at your desired level of browning or char.",
    "Serve immediately, they’re best right off the skillet. If you want to make extra for later, I would keep the raw dough balls in the fridge and cook as needed vs. making them all at once and storing them."
