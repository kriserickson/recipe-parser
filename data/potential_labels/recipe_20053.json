    "Step 1",
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until just tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a colander. Add bamboo shoots to the pot and cook until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer them to the colander.",
    "Step 2",
    "Meanwhile, mix chili crisp (or chili oil), vinegar, soy sauce, peppercorn oil and ginger in a large bowl.",
    "Step 3",
    "Add a third of the potato slices and bamboo shoots to the sauce. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, gently stir to make sure each slice gets coated on both sides. Carefully transfer to a platter, leaving any remaining sauce in the bowl. Repeat with the remaining vegetables, one-third at a time. Spoon any remaining sauce over the top and sprinkle with scallions and chiles and ground Sichuan peppercorns to taste."
