    "Add the remaining ingredients and process until completely smooth. Scrape the sides and let it go for several minutes. I let mine go for at least 5 minutes or longer until it was creamy dreamy smooth. Thatâ€™s the key to getting that silky smooth texture. The longer you blend, the smoother it will get. Taste and adjust any spices if needed.",
    "Place in a serving bowl and add optional toppings. This makes a beautiful display if serving at a party. I added olives, fresh basil and red pepper flakes to mine for a beautiful presentation."
