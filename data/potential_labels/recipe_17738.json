    "In a large sauce pot, melt coconut oil over medium heat. Once warm, add leeks to the pot and sauté for about 5 minutes.",
    "Add minced garlic to the pot, stir, and cook until the leeks are translucent (about 3-5 more minutes)",
    "Add broth, salt, and pepper to the pot and bring to a boil.",
    "Once the leeks and broth are boiling, add the potatoes to the pot. Turn the heat down to medium-low, cover, and allow the soup to simmer for 20 minutes.",
    "Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until it has a smooth consistency. If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can also blend the soup (carefully!) in small batches in your blender. Add coconut milk to the soup and stir to combine. Check for flavor and add salt and/or pepper to adjust to your personal taste.",
    "Enjoy the soup warm, garnished with red pepper flakes, paprika, pepitas, or coconut cream. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week or in freezer for up to a month."
