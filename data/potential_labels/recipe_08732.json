    "Mix all the spice rub ingredients together and remove the grouper from the refrigerator. Cover all surfaces of the fish with a light to medium covering of the spice rub and gently rub into the grouper. Let this rest in a container outside of the refrigerator to allow it to reach room temperature before putting it on the grill.",
    "Get your grill going and achieve a medium hot grill. Place the grouper fillets in a grill basket or on a grill screen with smaller holes to keep the fillet from falling apart and crumbling through the grill as it gets closer to done. Cook for approximately 5 to 6 minutes per side. You only need to flip it once on the grill.",
    "Note: If you're unsure of whether it's fully cooked or not, you can test it with a digital meat thermometer at the center of the thickest part of the fillet. The temperature should read approximately 135Â° F."
