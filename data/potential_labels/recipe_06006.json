    "After following the directions for Bon Appetit's one ingredient sweet potato caramel lower the oven temperature to its lowest setting (mine was 200 degrees F).",
    "After squeezing as much liquid as possible from the sweet potato, spread the mash evenly on one baking sheet and put in oven.",
    "Prop open the oven slightly with a utensil, so that moisture can escape (you are essentially dehydrating the sweet potato mash).",
    "Dehydrate for 5-6 hours, checking occasionally.",
    "Allow the dehydrated sweet potato mash to cool; it should now be very crispy and breakable.",
    "Break the dehydrated mash into pieces, put in a high speed blender (I used my Vitamix), and blend into a powder."
