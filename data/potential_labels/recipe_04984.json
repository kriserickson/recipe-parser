    "Combine oil, honey, soy sauce and fish sauce in a shallow dish. Add the salmon fillets and marinate for up to two hours but at least 20 minutes, turning once halfway through.",
    "When ready to cook the fish heat a pan over medium heat. Drain the salmon from the marinade reserving the liquid. Add the fillets to the hot pan and cook for 3-4 minutes. Turn over and cook for about 1 minute. Add the marinade and continue cooking for 4-5 minutes, basting the fish with the marinade. Turn over again and cook for another 1-2 minutes or until done. Remove the fish and sauce from the pan and set aside on a warmed plate.",
    "Wipe the pan and put it back on the heat, increasing to high. Put the sesame oil into the pan and cook the Bok Choy for 1 minute on each side. Add the sesame seeds and lemon zest and continue cooking for 1 minute on each side. Deglaze with the broth and cook for another 3-4 minutes or until softened.",
    "Serve the salmon on top of the Bok Choy with the remaining sauce."
