    "Place peppers, garlic, sugar, and salts in your food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Transfer mixture to a clean jar, then cover and let sit at room temperature. (I use a mason jar with the lid screwed on very loosely. You want to give your mixture a little breathing room, so don’t screw the top on too tight. Alternatively, you could forgo the jar/lid combo and just use a bowl and plastic wrap.) Store in a dark, dry place.",
    "Check the jar every day for fermentation. (This should begin after 2 to 3 days, but might take a little longer in colder, drier weather.) Once you begin to see some bubbly liquid-y magic at the bottom of the jar, fermentation has begun. Stir the mash each day, until it is no longer rising in volume from the fermentation. (This should take 5 to 7 days.)",
    "Transfer the mash to your food processor/blender, add the vinegar, and puree until very smooth. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve, stirring and mashing it through until all that remains are seeds and larger bits of peppers. Return the sauce to the clean bowl of your food processor or blender, and sprinkle xanthan gum over top. Pulse until the gum is incorporated and the sauce has thickened. Transfer to food-safe squeeze bottles or an airtight container and store in the fridge for up to six months."
