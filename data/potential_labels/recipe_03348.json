    "Soak noodles in cold water to cover 30 minutes, then drain. Cook noodles in a large (5- to 6-quart) pot of boiling salted water 4 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander, then rinse thoroughly and drain well.",
    "Stir together soy sauce and water, then reserve.",
    "Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in wok or skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering, then add eggs and stir-fry until just cooked through, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate and wipe out pan, if necessary.",
    "Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in pan until shimmering and stir-fry shrimp and chile paste 30 seconds (shrimp will not be cooked through).",
    "Add chorizo and garlic and stir-fry until shrimp are just cooked through, 30 seconds to 1 minute.",
    "Add soy mixture, cooked noodles, jicama, and scallions, and stir-fry until noodles are heated through and scallion greens are wilted, about 1 minute.",
    "Remove pan from heat and stir in eggs. Serve immediately.",
    "Cooks' Notes: •In the 30 minutes it takes to soak the noodles, all other prep work can be done, including bringing the water to a boil to cook the noodles. •The chile paste is quite strong when it hits the pan, and will likely cause you to cough, so if you have a vent fan, turn it on high. •Some people prefer their chorizo with casing removed, but in Asia, they wouldnt remove the casing on Chinese sausage, so its your choice whether you want to remove it or not."
