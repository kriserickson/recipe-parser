    "Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Cut each round pita in half to make them easier to work with, then separate the two layers of the pita bread (use a knife to create clean edges instead of torn edges). Cut each piece of pita into 1-inch triangles and place them in a large bowl.",
    "Melt the butter in the microwave, then stir in the vanilla extract. Drizzle the vanilla butter over the pita triangles in the bowl and toss until the pita is completely coated in butter.",
    "Spread the butter coated pita pieces out over a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake the pitas in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Stir the pita pieces every 3-4 minutes as they bake to make sure they cook evenly and to keep an eye on the browning. Every oven varies a bit as do pita pieces, so base your baking time on the color and texture of the pita pieces, rather than a strict 8-10 minutes. They should be golden and crispy when finished.",
    "After baking, transfer the pita crisps back to the buttered bowl. In a separate small dish stir together the sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon mixture over the baked pita crisps, then toss until they are well coated in cinnamon and sugar. Serve immediately, or allow the crisps to cool and store in an air-tight container."
