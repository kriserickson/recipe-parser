    "Instructions",
    "In a medium bowl, add pork, soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, corn starch, garlic and ginger. Mix with a spatula until well combined.",
    "Heat a wok or frying pan on medium high. Add vegetable oil. Cook the pork mixture until meat is no longer pink.",
    "Add shredded cabbage and carrots and cook for 2 minutes longer. Season with additional salt and pepper as needed.",
    "Place one egg roll wrapper on a clean surface rotating it as a diamond shape. Spoon 1/3 cup of the pork mixture in the center of the wrapper from left to right. Grab the bottom corner and fold it over the mixture tucking it in. Then, fold the sides in and proceed to roll the egg roll until there is no more wrapper. Dab the top corner of the egg roll wrapper with water so it adheres to the roll. Continue to make as many rolls as there is filling.",
    "Heat peanut oil on medium high. When oil is ready, fry each egg roll until they are golden brown. Remove from oil to a plate lined with a paper towel. Serve immediately."
