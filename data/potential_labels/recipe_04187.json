    "Cut the peeled onions in halves and then quarters from pole to pole. Cut each quarter, pole to pole, in 1/4 inch slices. Coat inside of slow cooker with cooking spray. Add sliced onions and olive oil to slow cooker; toss with tongs or 2 forks to separate slices and distribute olive oil. Cover and cook on high for approx. 12-14 hours, until browned to desired color. Keep an eye on them during the last few hours of cooking time; if they begin to burn around the edges, stir, recover, and continue cooking until caramelized throughout.",
