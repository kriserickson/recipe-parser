    "Instructions:",
    "Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a 12-inch, deep skillet or saute pan and place over medium heat. Add the chopped chicken and cook, stirring frequently. Sprinkle the chicken with Italian seasoning, a touch of salt and fresh ground pepper, and continue cooking for 3 or 4 minutes or until chicken is completely cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover to keep warm.",
    "Add the remaining olive oil to pan and add the onions. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes, until softened and lightly browned. Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. Add broth, tomatoes, dry pasta, crushed red pepper and a little more salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Stir in the cooked chicken and bring to a boil, cover the skillet, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until the pasta is tender, about 15 minutes.",
    "Stir in the half-and-half and mozzarella and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes until the mixture is warmed through and cheese has melted.",
    "Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the fresh spinach until it wilts from heat of the pasta. Top with Parmesan and serve."
