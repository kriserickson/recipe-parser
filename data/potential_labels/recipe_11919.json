    "1. Throw all ingredients (except last 1/2 cup of tomatoes) in a high-speed blender and blend up 'til nice and smooth and well mixed. You can let this raw tomato soup recipe blend in the Vitamix or Blendtec blender for a little extra time so that the heat of the blades and the friction actually warm up this delicious, creamy raw tomato soup recipe.",
    "2. Transfer raw tomato soup to a bowl. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes and mix gently with a spoon.",
    "3. Garnish the raw tomato soup recipe with sunflower sprouts! Eat immediately."
