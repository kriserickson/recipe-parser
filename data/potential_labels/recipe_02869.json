    "Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a large Dutch oven.",
    "Combine the flour and cornmeal and mix together. Toss half the oysters into the cornmeal mix and move them around, coating each oyster completely in the mix. Place the oysters into hot oil and carefully move around to prevent the oysters from sticking together. Only leave the oysters in the oil for 1 to 2 minutes as they cook quickly. Season, to taste, with salt immediately after cooking. Repeat with the remaining oysters.",
    "Place the oysters on the French bread while they are still hot and add the sliced cheese and bacon. Enjoy!!!",
