    "Preheat oven to 375Â°. In a large ovenproof skillet, heat 2 Tbsp. olive oil over medium-high heat. Add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and 1 bunch Swiss chard, thinly sliced; cook, stirring, until wilted, 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; transfer to a plate. Slice baguette into 14 1/4\"-thick slices and rub with garlic; arrange half the bread slices in skillet. Top with sliced tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Layer chard, sliced mozzarella, and remaining bread slices; drizzle with olive oil. Bake until tomatoes are very soft, about 15 minutes. Let rest, then cut into wedges."
