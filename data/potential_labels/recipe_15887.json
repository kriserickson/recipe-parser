    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper so you don’t end up with cheese stuck to your pan.",
    "On the prepared baking sheet, toss the broccoli with the oil until all of the florets are lightly coated. Arrange them in an even layer across the pan, then sprinkle salt lightly on top.",
    "Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven. Toss the broccoli with a spatula and arrange it in an even layer across the pan again. Sprinkle the Parmesan over the broccoli, then return the pan to the oven. Bake for 10 more minutes, or until the florets are turning deeply golden on the edges and the Parmesan is golden and bubbly.",
    "Drizzle balsamic lightly over the broccoli and grate lemon zest on top, to taste. Sprinkle with a pinch of red pepper flakes and flaky salt. This side dish is best served warm, but you can store leftovers in the refrigerator for several days. Gently reheat in the microwave before serving."
