    "Before starting, please make sure you don’t mix your pancake batter too thoroughly. An overly mixed batter can often result in flatter, rather listless pancakes, so a good rule of thumb is to not worry about leaving lumps in the mix. In fact, lumps are a good thing!",
    "Another thing to remember is that you won’t be able to see bubbles forming as much as you would with plain old wheat flour, so I’d suggest using a fork or spatula to gently lift your pancakes before flipping, just to make sure the underside is nicely browned.",
    "Thoroughly mix the eggs, coconut oil, and honey together.",
    "Add the coconut milk and vanilla extract.",
    "Throw in the coconut flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix, but remember, not too much!",
    "Melt a dab of butter in your skillet and then using a measuring cup, add a little batter to the pan. I recommend figuring out how many pancakes you’d like to make beforehand so that you can use an appropriately sized cup or ladle. This recipe should yield around 8 or so pancakes.",
    "Remember that you aren’t likely to see many bubbles forming on the top, so carefully check the underside of your pancake before flipping. Extra kudos points for those of you who can flip without a spatula!",
    "For best results, serve your pancakes right away.",
    "Drown those bad boys in maple syrup, grab your fork, and have at ‘em!",
    "Pancakes have always been a serious weakness of mine, and there’s no way I’m letting you guys in on just how many batches I made in my attempts to find the perfect recipe…"
