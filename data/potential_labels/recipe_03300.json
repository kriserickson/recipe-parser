    "Begin a large pot of salted water to boil. Once the water reaches a full boil, add the noodles and cook according to the package directions (about 4-5 minutes).",
    "While waiting for the water to boil, prepare the spicy sriracha sauce. In a small bowl stir together the brown sugar, soy sauce, sriracha, ginger, and sesame oil.",
    "In a large skillet melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium-low heat. Add the crushed red pepper to the butter, and once it's completely melted whisk in the eggs. Stir gently and cook for about 3 minutes. Once the egg is done cooking, keep the pan on the burner but transfer eggs to a small plate; set aside. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan and increase the heat to medium-high. Add shrimp and cook for 2 minutes on each side, or just until firm and bright pink. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a clean plate; set aside. Add zucchini to the pan, increase heat to high, and remaining oil; stir fry until just charred; about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for one minute.",
    "Add drained noodles to the skillet along with the cooked egg, shrimp, and prepared sauce. Turn the heat on to medium-low, and stir until everything is coated well with the sauce. Sprinkle the sliced green onions and cilantro and serve at once!"
