    "1 Heat the oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saut√© for 4-5 minutes, until they begin to brown on the edges.",
    "2 Add the garlic and rice, stir well and cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring often.",
    "3 Add the grated ginger, salt, water, stock and coconut milk and stir well. Add the kidney beans and sprinkle the thyme over everything. Add the whole Scotch bonnet chile (or habanero); it will season the rice much like a bay leaf would. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat to low and cover.",
    "4 The rice should be done in about 15-20 minutes, depending on the type of rice you are using (some long grained rice takes longer to cook). Check after 15 minutes. Once done, remove from heat and cover for 10 minutes. To serve, fluff with a fork. Sprinkle with a little lime juice if you want. Discard the habanero (or eat it, if you dare!)"
