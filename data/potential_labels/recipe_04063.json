    "To Make the Balsamic Vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, garlic, herbs, salt and pepper. Set aside.",
    "Place your vegetables into a large resealable plastic bag. Pour half of the vinaigrette inside the bag, and seal. Turn the bag so that the vinaigrette coats the vegetables. Let it sit for at least 1 hour.",
    "Place a grill pan over medium heat, or bring your grill to medium-high heat.",
    "Pour the vegetables out onto a large baking sheet and roughly group like vegetables together. Sprinkle all of the vegetables with salt and pepper.",
    "Working in batches, grill the vegetables: about 8 minutes for the bell peppers, 5 to 6 minutes for the zucchini and squash, 4 minutes for the mushrooms and onion, and 1 to 2 minutes for the tomatoes. Flip each vegetable halfway through its cooking time.",
    "Transfer the vegetables to a large platter. Serve with the remaining vinaigrette."
