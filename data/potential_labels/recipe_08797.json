    "1. Preheat the oven to 350˚.",
    "2. Drain the peppers; slit them lengthwise and remove the seeds.",
    "3. Cut the Monterey Jack cheese into long pieces, and put it in the peppers. (The peppers won’t totally surround the cheese, which is okay.)",
    "4. Put the peppers in a greased 10x6x2-inch baking dish.",
    "5. Combine the eggs and milk; add the flour, baking powder, and salt and beat until smooth.",
    "6. Pour the egg mixture over the chiles. Cover with the shredded cheddar cheese."
