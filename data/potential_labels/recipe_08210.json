    "Instructions",
    "Shell and remove the tails from the shrimp and rinse. Place in a bowl and drizzle with the olive oil, lime juice and lime zest and season with the kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
    "Skewer the shrimp and heat the grill to medium heat. Brush the grill with oil or cooking spray and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side then remove and let cool.",
    "When cooled, remove the shrimp from the skewers and slice in half from head to tail and set aside.",
    "Fill a large plate or pyrex dish with warm water, dip a rice wrapper into the warm water and completely submerge the wrapper for 1 minute. Set on the wrapper on a clean, flat surface and arrange a few slices of the veggies and herbs on the bottom ⅓ of the wrapper then top with a few lettuce leaves, a small handful of the vermicelli noodles then more veggie slices and herbs.",
    "Place 3 shrimp halves, grilled side down, on the rice paper just above the pile of the vermicelli and veggie pile. Fold the bottom of rice paper over vermicelli and veggie pile and roll over to form a cylinder. Fold in the two sides of the cylinder to make a package and keep folding over until it resembles a burrito shaped roll. Cut in half or in thirds, and serve with peanut and nuac cham dipping sauces.",
    "For the Peanut Sauce",
    "Mix all of the ingredients together in a small bowl until smooth. Serve at room temperature.",
    "For the Nuac Cham Dipping Sauce",
    "Mix all of the ingredients together in a small bowl until sugar has dissolved. Serve at room temperature."
