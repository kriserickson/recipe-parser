    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large skillet heat oil over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, carrot, onion, and garlic; cook and stir for 4 to 5 minutes or until tender. In a large bowl combine eggs, milk, the 3 tablespoons ketchup, the 1 tablespoon mustard, the Worcestershire sauce, and kosher salt. Add bread crumbs and vegetable mixture, stirring until evenly moistened.",
    "Add ground beef; using your clean hands, mix well. Line a 3-quart rectangular baking dish with foil. Lightly pat the mixture into a 9x5-inch loaf in the prepared dish.",
    "For glaze, in a small bowl combine the 1/2 cup ketchup, the brown sugar, and the 2 teaspoons mustard; set aside. (For a change of pace, substitute one of the glaze options below for the ketchup-brown sugar glaze.)",
