    "1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil and fry the onions until they are golden.",
    "2. Add the garlic, rosemary, potatoes and chickpeas (after washing and filtering), fry a little, then add the wine.",
    "3. Add the water and boil, then cook half-covered over a small fire for about 2 hours. The chickpeas should soften completely but keep their shape. Remove about a third of the chickpeas from the pot. During cooking, take out the rosemary branches.",
    "4. Add the salt (about 1.5 tbs), pepper and chili.",
    "5. Purée the soup (preferably) using a (hand held) food processor. Put the cooked chickpeas back in.",
    "6. Add the pasta and cook shortly (don’t over cook the pasta).",
    "7. Serve hot with a slight drizzle of olive oil.",
    "Note that different varieties of chickpeas will make different textures and flavors. The larger ones (Garbanzo Bean or “Spanish chickpea”) give a much thicker soup. The smaller ones have a more delicate flavor and require less cooking."
