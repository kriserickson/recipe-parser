    "Blend the eggs in a blender, gradually incorporating the sugar into the yolks. Add the vanilla and a pinch of salt. Then add the half-and-half and heavy cream, along with the nutmeg. Blend vigorously until thickened and a foam forms on the top. (For a less-rich nog, use milk instead of half-and-half and fewer eggs; to reduce sweetness to taste, reduce sugar.)",
    "Pour the mixture into a pitcher or bowl, and stir in approximately 1/4 cup good rum, 1/8 cup bourbon, 1/8 cup Cognac (or more if you like it boozy).",
    "Sprinkle ground nutmeg on each glass of nog before serving. Makes 4 to 6 glasses, depending on serving sizes.",
