    "How To Make It:",
    "1. Before preparing any of the ingredients, preheat your oven to 350F.",
    "2. Grease a baking tray or line it with baking paper.",
    "3. Now it’s time to get messy: Mix the coconut flour, salt, eggs, coconut oil, honey, and vanilla extract together thoroughly with a whisk.",
    "4. Continue whisking and you’ll notice the mixture change consistency from runny to slightly thicker as the coconut flour begins to soak up the moisture from the wet ingredients.",
    "5. If the mixture remains runny then you might want to add a small amount of extra coconut flour until the right consistency is achieved."
