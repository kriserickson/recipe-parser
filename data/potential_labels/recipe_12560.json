    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay cooked lasagna noodles flat, in an even layer, on a greased baking sheet.",
    "Bread chicken. Season both sides of chicken with salt and pepper. Put flour and breadcrumbs in two separate medium bowls. Whisk together two eggs in a third separate bowl. Working in batches, dredge chicken in the flour then dip in eggs. Toss in breadcrumbs for the final dredge.",
    "In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add chicken and cook until golden-brown and cooked through, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into small bite-size pieces, about 1/2‚Äù cubes.",
    "Meanwhile, make filling. Whisk together ricotta, remaining egg, garlic powder and 1/2 cup Parmesan. Spread ricotta mixture onto each lasagna noodle, then spoon marinara sauce over the ricotta. Top with cooked chicken and mozzarella then roll up tightly.",
