    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Peel the carrots, sweet potato, and the turnip (turnips usually have a thick wax coating applied before sale). Peel the red potato if desired. Cut all of the vegetables into one inch pieces (potatoes, turnip, onion, carrots). Place all of the chopped vegetables on a large baking sheet covered with foil.",
    "Mince the garlic and add it to the baking sheet along with the basil, thyme, and rosemary. Drizzle the olive oil over top of everything and then use your hands to toss everything to coat. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper.",
    "Spread the vegetables out so that they are in a single layer on the baking sheet, moving half to a second baking sheet if needed. Roast in the oven for 45 minutes or until soft and golden brown on the edges. Stir the vegetables half way through.",
    "After roasting, transfer the vegetables to a large bowl. Roughly chop the fresh parsley and stir into the roasted vegetables. Season with more salt and pepper as needed. Serve warm!"
