    "Wash and thoroughly dry cauliflower, then remove all greens and cut into 4 even sections (see photo).",
    "With a box grater, use the medium-sized holes (see photo - the side commonly used to grate cheese), or a food processor with the grater attachment, to grate the cauliflower into the size of rice, leaving any large, tough stems behind.",
    "Transfer to a clean towel or paper towel and press to remove any excess moisture, which can make your dish soggy.",
    "Once you have your cauliflower rice, it's easy to cook! Simply saut√© in a large skillet over medium heat in 1 Tbsp oil. Cover with a lid so the cauliflower steams and becomes more tender. Cook for a total of 5-8 minutes, then season as desired (such as with soy sauce or salt and pepper).",
    "Use cauliflower rice in recipes that call for rice, such as stir fries, fesenjan, or fried rice!"
