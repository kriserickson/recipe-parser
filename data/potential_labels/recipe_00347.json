Add 5 of the chopped garlic cloves; turn up heat and stir for 1 minute. Add the rice, stirring frequently until the grains are completely covered in oil and beginning to turn translucent.",

    "In separate pan, warm oil over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and fry for 1 to 2 minutes until they have softened and coloured a little. Add to the risotto. Make a quick parsley oil combining parsley, remaining chopped garlic clove and as much oil as you like. Drizzle over the risotto and serve immediately.",
