    "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes; drain.",
    "Lightly grease a skillet with cooking spray. Cook the prosciutto in the skillet over medium heat until just brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, drain excess fat and set prosciutto aside on paper towels.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the cream in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Slowly stir in 1 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in small amounts. When all the cheese has been melted, stir in the peas and prosciutto. Allow to heat for 2 minutes more. Pour over drained pasta and toss lightly. Season with salt to taste and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese."
