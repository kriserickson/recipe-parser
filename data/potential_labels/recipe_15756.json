    "First, make the topping: Melt the butter in a pan and add the brown sugar and spices. Use a whisk to combine. (If you’re having a hard time with it, let it sit for a few moments. Once it cools, it’ll be easier to mix.) Then add pecans, if you’re adding those.",
    "Pour the sauce into a medium-size rectangular casserole dish, making sure it spreads to all four corners. Then cut the bread up in 1/2-inch size slices (about 20 or so), and spread them out over the casserole.",
    "In a bowl, beat the eggs with the cream and the spices. Then pour over the bread, again making sure to cover completely and reach every corner. Cover with foil and refrigerate overnight. In the morning bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes or until the bread gets crusty on top."
