    "This low-sugar breakfast recipe can easily be adapted to become a decadent snack or a healthy dessert. The fat from the avocado and coconut butter along with the protein from the hazelnuts and pumpkin seeds will help keep blood sugar levels stable. Healing foods: -Cacao (magnesium, flavonoids as antioxidants, vitamin Bs and E) -Avocado (sugar-balancing, anti-inflammatory, nutritionally dense, anti-carcinogenic) -Coconut butter (supports plump skin, anti-bacterial, healthy fat for long term energy, high in fiber, precursor for many hormones) -Pumpkin seed (high in magnesium, zinc, protein, fiber, anti-oxidant, anti-fungal, anti-viral)",
