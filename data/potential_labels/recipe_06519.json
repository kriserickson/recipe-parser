    "Pour off and discard the brine from the chicken. Pat the chicken pieces completely dry. Whisk the batter to recombine. (Thin if necessary with Sprite, but should look like pancake batter.) Place half the chicken pieces in the batter and turn to coat. Remove the chicken from the batter, allowing any excess to drip back into the bowl, and carefully transfer it to the oil. Fry the chicken, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain the oil temperature between 300°F and 325°F (149°C and 163°C). Cook the fried chicken until deep golden brown and the meat registers 160°F/71°C, 12 to 25 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken pieces."
