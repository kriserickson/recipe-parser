    "Heat oven to 375°F. Spray 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish with cooking spray. In medium bowl, beat cream cheese, banana peppers, onion and Italian seasoning on medium speed until well blended.",
    "Unroll 1 dough sheet on work surface; reshape into 12x8-inch rectangle. Carefully spread half of the cream cheese mixture onto dough sheet, to within 1 inch of one of the short ends, leaving room to seal the seams.",
    "Place 4 ham slices evenly on top of cream cheese mixture, and layer with half of the salami slices and 4 cheese slices. Starting on the short, topped edge of rectangle, roll up tightly and pinch seam together. Repeat for remaining dough sheet.",
    "With serrated knife, carefully cut each roll into 6 slices, about 1 1/4 inches wide, and arrange spiral sides up in baking dish, reshaping into round shapes, if necessary. With pieces of waxed paper, gently press down on tops of rolls to flatten slightly.",
    "Bake 32 to 36 minutes or until golden brown and dough is baked through. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Serve warm."
