    "Set a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add in the olive oil. When hot, add in the onion and cook for about 2 minutes, until it starts to soften. Add in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add in the zucchini, squash, corn, salt, cumin and smoked paprika. Cook for about 6 to 8 minutes, until the veggies are all tender. Stir in the arugula and black beans, and cook until the arugula is wilted.",
    "Sprinkle the tortilla pieces over the top. Pour in the enchilada sauce, then toss to combine. Sprinkle the top of the mixture with the cheese, then cover the pan with a lid. Decrease the heat to medium low and continue to cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, until the cheese is melted and everything is nice and warm. Remove from the heat. Let stand for 5 minutes.",
