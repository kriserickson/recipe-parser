    "Make the meatballs:",
    "Preheat the oven to 500ÂºF. Spray a mini-muffin pan or baking dish with cooking spray.",
    "In a small bowl, stir together the milk and Panko breadcrumbs and let sit for 5 minutes.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, garlic, ginger, scallions, soy sauce, salt, pepper and soaked breadcrumbs. Use your hands to thoroughly combine the meat mixture and then shape it into balls using 2 to 3 tablespoons of meat per meatball.",
    "Place the shaped meatballs into the prepared pan and bake for 12 to 15 minutes until the meatballs are fully cooked. While the meatballs are baking, prepare the sauce.",
    "Make the sauce:",
    "Add the sesame oil and olive oil to a small saucepot over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes until golden brown.",
    "Add the red pepper flakes, orange marmalade and hoisin sauce, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly.",
    "Remove the meatballs from the oven and transfer them into a large bowl. Pour the sauce on top and toss to coat. Serve immediately.",
    "Kelly's Note:",
    "If you can't find ground chicken at your local supermarket, feel free to use ground turkey, which is often easier to find."
