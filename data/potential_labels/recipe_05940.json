    "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place potato cubes in large pan of cold, salted water and bring to a boil. In colander, drain potatoes immediately; allow to steam a few minutes until they dry out a bit. Bash up rosemary leaves with pestle and mortar (or back of knife).",
    "In roasting pan, heat about 1/4 cup olive oil; add garlic, potatoes, and rosemary. Season and toss together until well-coated. Place pan in oven, shaking it every so often, until potatoes are golden and crispy â€” about 30 to 35 minutes."
