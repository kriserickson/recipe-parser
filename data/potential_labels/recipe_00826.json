    "In a bowl, combine the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, and basil. Season generously with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Using a pastry bag, fitted with a small round tip, pipe about 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of ricotta mixture into the center of the zucchini blossoms. The blossoms should be able to close on their own--do not over-fill, or the mixture will spill during frying.",
    "In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder. Slowly pour in the seltzer water, and whisk until combined. It should foam, and eventually become the consistency of yogurt or sour cream. Season mixture with salt. Set aside.",
    "In a large straight-sided saute pan, add theÂ safflower oil until it comes up to roughly an inch on the sides. Heat over medium-high heat, or until temperature reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Set aside a plate lined with paper towels.",
    "Dip the stuffed zucchini blossoms into the batter and wipe any excess batter off the side of the bowl. Fry the blossoms (4 to 5 at a time--do not overcrowd the pan) until golden brown on all sides.",
    "Remove from oil, place on paper-towel lined plate, and salt immediately. Repeat until all of the zucchini blossoms have been fried. Serve immediately with lemon wedges."
