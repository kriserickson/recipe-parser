    "How to make the recipe",
    "Wash rice till the water runs clear. Soak it for at least 10 mins and cook in lot of water with little oil, till al dente. Drain off the rice to a colander. Cool it.",
    "Heat a wok with oil on the highest flame, add chopped garlic sauté till they get fried slightly. If you wish to use mace and star anise you can use. They lend a wonderful flavour.",
    "Add all the chopped veggies and fry for a min or two. Add sugar if using. If you like very crunchy bell peppers add it in the next step.",
    "To make Indian fried rice recipe just add vinegar to the wok. To make Chinese style, add to the wok soya sauce, vinegar, salt.",
    "Add rice and pepper powder. Mix everything well and fry for 2 mins",
    "Garnish rice with fresh chopped spring onions.",
    "Notes",
