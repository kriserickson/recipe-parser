    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. On a baking sheet, drizzle squash halves with olive oil and rub all over until coated. Place a slice of butter in each and season generously with salt and pepper.",
    "Bake until squash is tender, 1 hour. Let cool until cool enough to handle.",
    "About 10 minutes before squash is finished baking, start soup: In a large pot over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy, stirring occasionally, 8 minutes. Drain half the fat. Reserve some bacon for garnish.",
    "Add onion and cook until softened, then stir in garlic and thyme until combined.",
    "Scoop out squash from skin and transfer to soup pot. Pour over chicken broth and season with more pepper. Simmer 15 minutes.",
    "Place an immersion blender into soup pot and blend until smooth and no chunks remain. (Alternatively, you can transfer soup in batches to a blender.)",
    "Ladle soup into bowls and serve topped with reserved bacon and more thyme."
