    "Heat the oil and add in the fennel and cumin seeds and wait for them to sizzle.",
    "Into this mixture add in the red onion, ginger, garlic and mix well. Cook on low heat for about 5 minutes until the onions are soft and just beginning to turn golden.",
    "Add in the tomato, cinnamon and the chilies and salt and cook this mixture for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. At this point, you should have a fairly smooth and dry gravy, with the onions soft and melted into thick sauce",
    "Fold in the spinach leaves and cook for another 3-4 minutes, until the spinach is just cooked through. The spinach should absorb the sauce into a thick soft mixture."
