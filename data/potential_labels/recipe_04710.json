    "Mix together all the spices and the flour in a shallow pan.",
    "Pat your fish filets dry with a towel or paper towel. Then, dredge each filet in the spice mixture until well covered.",
    "In a large frying pan, heat a couple of Tbs. of butter or olive oil over medium high heat. When the butter is foaming (or the oil is shimmering), add the fish and fry for a couple of minutes on each side, until cooked through (it will flake easily with a fork).",
    "Divide the fish between the 4 pieces of flatbread. Squirt the lime juice all over the fish. Then, top with cilantro, pickled onion, and yogurt. Roll up (actually, we kind of more ate them gently folded like a taco shell) and enjoy! Theyâ€™re pretty stuffed full so you have to eat them carefully, or else messily, whichever you prefer."
