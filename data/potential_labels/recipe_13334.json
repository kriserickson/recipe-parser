    "Chop the onion, sweet potatoes and carrots and mince the garlic. If you want, you could do 2 medium sweet potatoes or 6 whole carrots rather than 1 potato and 3 carrots. Your choice!",
    "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the veggies and garlic and saute over medium to medium-low heat for 10 minutes.",
    "Add the ground beef and add salt and pepper to taste. Saute until the beef is almost done. Add the flour, if using, and incorporate it fully.",
    "Then add the kale and 2 tablespoons of water and continue to cook and stir for 3-5 minutes until the kale is to your liking. I cooked it just past the bright green stage where it got darker green and had started to reduce. You want it softened, but not slimy!",
    "Enjoy!"
