    "Cut your onion into long thin strands - I use a mandoline. Use what you need and freeze the rest for another day.",
    "Cut apples into chunks - quarter the apple, then cut each quarter into thirds lengthwise, then cut each slice in half crosswise.",
    "Sage brown butter. On med-med high heat melt the butter (low & slow) until it starts to foam & turn brown. Add the sage brown for 15-30 seconds.",
    "Add onions. Sautee until caramelized (again, low & slow)",
    "Add apples. Stir until apples are covered in the butter",
    "Add thyme & rosemary...stir",
    "Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon...stir",
    "Add pork chops - you can either remove the apples, brown the chops and then add the apples back or just push the apples out of the way so the chops are touching the pan. Brown on one side. Flip brown & cook through on the other side. (The apples and onions can be on top of the chops while they are browning to give flavor.) At this point sometimes (not always, depends how fast they are cooking and how much butter and juice released from apples there is) I add just a teeny bit of water (or apple cider if you have it) and cover to make sure the chops are cooked through and softens the apples if needed. The chops are thin so they cook pretty quickly"
