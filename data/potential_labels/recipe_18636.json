    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare mini muffin pan by spraying each cup with non-stick cooking spray. Pour yellow butter cake mix into a medium bowl and whisk {or sift} to remove any lumps. Add softened butter and eggs to the cake mix and combine with a hand held mixer until dough is thick and sticky. Using a small cookie scoop {or 1/2 tbsp.}, put a mound of cookie dough into each muffin cup. Using your fingers, go back and press the mound of dough down to create a level cookie. Bake for 7-8 minutes. {Do not over cook, they will set up as they cool.} Remove from oven and let the cookie cool for 4-5 minutes. Once cooled, go back and use a tart shaper {or end of a wooden spoon} to press middle of cookie down and create a indentation. Move cookies to cooling rack and let them cool completely."
