    "Beat eggs for about 2 minutes, until frothy. Add coconut milk, vanilla, and honey to the bowl, and mix well. Add baking soda, coconut flour, and sea salt, and mix until smooth. Slightly mash up the blueberries, and add them to the mixture. Heat the butter in a pan over medium heat (you may not need to use the full tablespoon at one time - use enough to grease the pan). Add pancake batter to the pan in 2-3 inch diameter rounds. Cook for a few minutes on each side until brown and the top is dried and bubbly. Flip and repeat. When pancakes are fully cooked, move them to a plate and top with some more blueberries and a little maple syrup. Delicious!"
