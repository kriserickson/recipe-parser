    "Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, ginger, and carrots. Season with a pinch each sea salt and black pepper and stir. Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently, until onions are soft and fragrant.",
    "Add garlic and potatoes and stir. Cook for 3-4 minutes to brown slightly, and then add curry powder. Stir to coat. Cook 2 minutes more.",
    "Add lesser amount of vegetable broth (5 cups or 1200 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and increase heat to medium-high. Once at a low boil, add lentils, stir, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20-25 minutes, uncovered, or until lentils and potatoes are tender.",
    "Taste and adjust seasonings, adding coconut sugar for a little sweetness (optional), more curry powder for intense curry flavor, or sea salt and pepper for more balance. I added more of each.",
    "If the soup has thickened too much, add remaining vegetable broth (1 cup or 240 mlÂ as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) , stir, and cook until warmed through.",
    "In the last few minutes of cooking, add the kale and cover to steam until tender but still vibrant green - about 2-3 minutes.",
    "Serve immediately as is or with cilantro and fresh lemon juice (optional). This would also go well with my Easy Vegan Wheat Bread, or Garlic & Herb Flatbread! Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month."
