    "Remove Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry to thaw according to package directions.",
    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.",
    "Once thawed, unfold the dough onto a lightly floured surface.",
    "Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the dough with the beaten egg.",
    "Then, use a biscuit cutter or circle cookie cutter to cut the dough (1 got 12-15 circles per sheet).",
    "Place cut circles into the mini muffin tin pan cups. Gently stab the bottoms with a fork.",
    "Bake at 400 for about 15 minutes (until the pastry starts to become golden brown).",
    "While the dough bakes, prepare the lemon filling. In a small bowl, stir together the lemon curd and whipped cream until well combined (you should end up with a light yellow color & creamy texture).",
    "Remove pans from the oven and immediately press down the centers of the dough with a spoon to create wells.",
    "Fill with a spoonful of the lemon filling. Top with a raspberry & a dusting of powdered sugar!"
