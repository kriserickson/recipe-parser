    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and adjust the rack to the middle position. Place muffin liners in a muffin pan. Place the coconut flour, sea salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder in a large mixing bowl and whisk until incorporated. In another large mixing bowl, whisk the melted chocolate, butter, maple syrup, eggs, yogurt and vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. Let the batter sit for 10 minutes. Divide the batter evenly amount the muffin tin and fill each muffin cup 3/4 full. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until cake tester inserted in the middle of a cupcake comes out clean. Cool completely.",
    "Whisk together all of the frosting ingredients for about 2 minutes with a mixer until soft peaks form. Place the frosting in the refrigerator for 30 minutes (this helps the gelatin set a bit more and give the frosting more structure).",
    "To frost: Spoon a few tablespoons of frosting on a cupcake (I like to use a cookie scoop so that I have an even amount of frosting on each cupcake) and then even out with an off-set spatula. Top with a whole strawberry. If you need to make these ahead of time, it's best if they are stored in the fridge and then set out for 20 minutes before serving.",
