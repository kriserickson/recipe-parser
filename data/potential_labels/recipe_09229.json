    "Slice the bananas into approx. Â¼ inch slices (medallions).",
    "Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Lay the banana slices on the parchment paper, allowing the slices space in between so as not to touch each other (if they touch, they become more difficult to puree).",
    "Place in the freezer and freeze overnight, or for at least 3-4 hours to allow to fully harden.",
    "Once frozen, place the banana slices into the bowl of a food processor.",
    "Pulse the banana in the food processor. At first, the the banana will look crumbly. Scrape down the sides of the food processor with a spatula.",
    "Continue blending and the banana will start to look mushy. Scrape down the sides of the food processor again.",
    "Continue blending until the last tiny pieces of banana smooth out. The consistency will turn from blended banana to a soft-serve ice cream texture.",
    "At this point, if you wanted to add in chocolate chips or cinnamon or another addition, do so.",
    "While you could eat the ice cream right now, it will be super soft, so I recommend transferring it to an airtight container and freezing until solid, approximately 1-2 hours.",
    "If. upon removing from the freezer, the ice cream is too solid to eat, allow to set for 10 minutes at room temperature before serving."
