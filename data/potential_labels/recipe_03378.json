Depending on how many strawberries you used, their size, your blender, and your desired smoothie thickness and consistency, you may need more than 1/4 cup cream (I used about 1/2 cup), or add a splash of water, to reach desired consistency.",
    "Serve immediately. Leftover portion may be stored in the freezer for later consumption for up to 2 months. The smoothie does not change consistency and taste is not effected upon thawing."
