    "This is the spinach smoothie for people who don’t like spinach—but want to. Thanks to the addition of mango, pineapple and banana, you won’t even taste the leafy green—but you’ll still reap all of its health benefits. In fact, this drink serves up 33 percent of the day’s vitamin A—most of which comes from the leaves. The addition of chia seeds and flax provides four grams of satiating fiber so be sure to keep those in the mix if you’re looking to sip as much protein as possible."
