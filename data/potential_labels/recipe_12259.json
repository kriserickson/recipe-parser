    "Spray the inside of your crock pot with non-stick cooking spray.",
    "Place all your oats, flax, salt, nuts/seeds and cinnamon in the crock pot and mix to combine.",
    "Pour in your coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract and mix until all the dry mixture is coated with the wet mixture.",
    "Turn the crock pot onto high, and let cook for 3 hours. Leave the lid slightly off, if your crock pot does not have a steam-escape vent.",
    "Every 30 minutes, give the granola a good mix. This will prevent the oats and nuts from burning.",
    "When the nuts are roasted, and the oats are crisp, turn off the crock pot and let cool. Stir in your chopped dried fruit.",
    "Store in air tight containers (we used mason jars)."
