    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray to prevent sticking. Set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, mix together the eggs, coconut sugar, tahini, coconut oil and vanilla extract until smooth.",
    "Next add the dry ingredients: almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda and salt. Mix until a cookie dough consistency forms, then fold in the chocolate chips.",
    "Add batter to the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 18-25 minutes until edges are just slightly golden. We want to slightly underbake these so they stay gooey. Once done baking, immediately sprinkle with Maldon salt; remove blondies from pan after 15 minutes. Cut into 16 bars and serve! Delicious with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream for a blondie sundae."
