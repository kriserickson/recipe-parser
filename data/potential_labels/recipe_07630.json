    "Place your chicken thighs in a gallon-sized Ziploc bag. Add the oil to the bag, seal it, and toss and turn the chicken inside the bag until they're all well-coated in oil.",
    "Mix all the seasonings in a small bowl then pour them into the chicken bag. Seal it and toss and turn the chicken inside the bag until all of the chicken is well-coated with the seasoning mix. Refrigerate the chicken in the bag for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.",
    "When ready, heat up your grill (I used my Cuisinart griddler) and grill each side of the chicken for 5 to 6 minutes until chicken is cooked through and there are nice grill marks on both sides. Remove chicken from grill and set aside before cutting.",
    "While the chicken cools, prepare the corn mixture by combining all the ingredients in a medium sized bowl and tossing to mix well. Set aside.",
    "Make the guacamole with the instructions from the above recipe link.",
    "Transfer the cooled by warm chicken onto a cutting board and dice into cubes.",
    "Assemble the burrito bowl by putting a bed of rice into the bottom of a bowl then adding your toppings on. Enjoy!"
