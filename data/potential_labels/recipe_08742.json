    "To start your ball, wrap the yarn around your fingers about 20 times and then slip it off and wrap the yarn around the middle of that circle you just made about 20 more times.",
    "Now pinch the beginnings of your yarn ball together and keep wrapping! Make sure you wrap it nice and tight.",
    "Pretty soon you will have something that looks like this. Tuck the end of the yarn under some of the other strands of yarn to secure.",
    "Repeat above steps until you’ve made 4 or more balls.",
    "Now you are ready to give them the “felting” treatment. You are going to need one leg of a pair of pantyhose or tights. Put the first ball into the toe of the pantyhose and secure it there with a piece of embroidery floss or acrylic yarn. Do NOT use wool yarn, you don’t want this to felt.",
    "Toss the pantyhose “snake” into the washer (the hotter the water the better) and then into the dryer (again, the hotter the better. Speeds up the felting process.)"
