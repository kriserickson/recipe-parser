    "Scoop out about 3/4 cup of the mixture and place it the center of a tortilla. Carefully fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll it up! Place the chimichanga in a baking pan. Repeat until all of the tortillas have been filled. Note: amounts may vary depending on the size of the tortilla used.",
    "Spray the chimichangas in the pan with olive oil so that the outside becomes crispy when baked. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes at 410F, or until the outside is golden brown and crispy to touch.",
    "While those are baking, prepare some homemade guacamole! Truly make this your own so use the recipe I provided merely as a guideline and season to taste.",
    "Top the freshly baked chimichangas with guacamole and cilantro and enjoy!"
