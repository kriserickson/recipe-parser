    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and line a baking sheet with foil. In a large baking dish, rub pork with taco seasoning, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil. Transfer to prepared pan and roast until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F, about 1 hour. Transfer to a cutting board, cover with aluminum foil, and let rest until cool. Once cool enough to handle, shred.",
    "In a large pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook onion and garlic until soft and golden, 6 minutes, then add cumin and stir, 1 minute. Add canned chiles and cook 2 minutes. Add enchilada sauce, tomatoes, beans, corn, and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer and let cook, 15 minutes.",
    "Add shredded pork and cook until warmed through.",
    "Meanwhile, make tortilla crisps: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat remaining oil. Add tortilla strips and cook until crisp, tossing, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.",
    "Ladle soup topped with avocado and tortilla strips. Squeeze with lime."
