    "Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and peppers (both types), and sauté them until they are very tender and slightly browned, 5 – 7 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large measuring cup, combine the salsa and tomato sauce and crack the eggs into a medium bowl, trying to keep their yolks intact.",
    "When the vegetables are tender, add the salsa-tomato sauce mixture to the skillet, bring it to a low boil, and add the eggs (still trying to keep the yolks intact), topping them evenly with the cheese. Cover, reduce the heat, and poach the eggs over the simmering sauce for 6 – 10 minutes, until they are just firm. Top it with the sour cream and fresh herbs, if desired, and serve it immediately over or wrapped in the tortillas, coating the tortillas first with a couple of teaspoons of the beans, if desired."
