    "Stirring every 5-10 minutes, allow the apples to come to a simmer.",
    "Cook for about 20-30 minutes, until the apples are tender; some of them will start to fall apart which is good for the texture!",
    "Allow to cool for about 5 minutes before serving, or serve at room temperature or cold.",
    "This will keep for about a week in the fridge in an airtight jar or container."
