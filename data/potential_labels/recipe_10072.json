    "TO MAKE THE 20-MINUTE TERIYAKI CHICKEN:",
    "Season the chicken with a few generous pinches of salt and pepper. Set aside.",
    "In a large saute pan or wok, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and saute, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink on the inside.",
    "Meanwhile, as the chicken is cooking, prepare your teriyaki sauce.",
    "Once the chicken is ready to go, pour the teriyaki sauce over it, then toss to combine until the chicken is evenly coated. Continue cooking until the sauce reaches a simmer and thickens.",
    "Remove from heat, and serve immediately, garnished with optional toppings if desired.",
    "TO MAKE THE TERIYAKI SAUCE:",
    "Whisk all ingredients together until combined.",
    "I served this teriyaki chicken with rice (cooked in 20 minutes in my rice cooker) and broccoli (which I steamed, then tossed with a little bit of soy sauce and sesame oil while the chicken was cooking)."
