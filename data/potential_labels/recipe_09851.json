    "Place a large soup pot over medium heat and add in the onions, celery, carrots, garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until vegetables “sweat” and onions are translucent. Add in the thyme and oregano and cook for another 1 minute, stirring frequently.",
    "Place in the chicken thighs and bay leaf and pour in the chicken broth, water and cover and let come to a boil. Once boiling, lower to a steady simmer and cook for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the chicken and peel off the skin and discard. Then, shred the chicken off the bone and set aside, with any juices. Place the bones back into the soup pot and simmer for 10 more minutes, uncovered.",
    "While the bones simmer, slice the zucchinis halfway lengthwise. Then, spiralize them, using Blade C. Set aside.",
    "Remove the bones and bay leaves and discard. Add the reserved shredded chicken back to the pot along with the zucchini noodles. Cook for 5 minutes or until zucchini is al dente or cooked to your preference. Serve warm."
