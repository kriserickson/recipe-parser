    "Add generous amount of shredded coconut to a shallow bowl. Using a heaping tablespoon, roll dough between your hands before rolling it in the coconut to coat. Set aside on a plate and repeat with remaining dough. Store balls in an airtight container in the fridge for best results, or freeze for longer periods of time."
