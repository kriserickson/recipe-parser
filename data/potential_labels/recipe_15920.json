    "Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Sprinkle your work surface with all-purpose flour and work your ball of dough into a 16″ circle. It is easiest to first press down on the ball until it is a thick round disc then use a rolling pin to roll it out the rest of the way. Place the stretched out dough onto a pizza pan or pizza stone (mine was non-stick, if yours isn’t, spray with non-stick spray).",
    "Drizzle 2 Tbsp of olive oil on the dough and spread it evenly around with your hand. Sprinkle the dried basil and oregano on top of the oil.",
    "Next, evenly spread the fresh spinach over the dough. I like to put the fresh spinach down first so that the other toppings (including the cheese) are on top and keep the spinach moist. Follow the spinach with the mozzarella, goat cheese, pepperoni, caramelized onions, roasted garlic and artichoke hearts.",
    "Bake the pizza at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes or until the cheese has melted and the crust is a nice brown color. Enjoy!"
