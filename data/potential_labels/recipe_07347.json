    "Place a layer of onions in the bottom of 6 1/2 quart crock pot. Create small slits in surface of pork roast (top and bottom) and add a clove of garlic to each slit. Season with salt and pepper and each side before adding to crock pot. Add additional layer of onions. Cover and cook on high 6 hours (or low 10 – 12 hours).",
    "One hour before roast is done cooking, add all ingredients for BBQ sauce to a small pot and warm over medium heat. When the sauce begins to steam, reduce the heat to low and let it cook for 15 to 20 minutes. The sauce will thicken slightly and the flavors will combine (cutting the cook time down will result in an uneven, sour flavor… so don’t do that). Remove from heat and set aside.",
    "Remove roasts from crock pot. Discard onion, garlic, and liquid from crock pot. Trim fat from roasts. Pull pork apart into pieces of varying size and return to crock pot. Add chopped red onion and 2/3 of sauce. Mix until combined and cook on high an additional 2 hours. Serve on crusty buns with remaining 1/3 of sauce to spoon on top."
