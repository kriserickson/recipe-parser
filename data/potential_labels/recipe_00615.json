    "Add all ingredients (except butter) into a breadmaker, first the wet ingredients (milk, cream, egg yolk, whisked egg, tangzhong), then followed by the dry ingredients (salt, sugar, milk powder, bread flour, yeast). (Note: I used to make a small well in the bread flour, then add the yeast into it.) Select the “dough” mode (refer to the menu of your breadmaker to select the kneading dough programme). When all ingredients come together, add butter, continue kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic. (The time of kneading in my breadmaker is about 30 minutes.) Then let the dough complete the 1st round of proofing, about 40 minutes, best temperature for proofing is 28C, humidity 75%, until double in size.",
    "Transfer the dough to a clean floured surface. Deflate and divide into 6 equal portions (see picture 1). Cover with cling wrap, let rest for 15 minutes at room temperature.",
    "Roll out each portion of the dough with a rolling pin into an oval shape (See picture 2). Fold 1/3 from top edge to the middle and press (see picture. Then roll to the bottom. Pinch to seal (see picture 4). Turn seal downward. Roll and stretch to about 20cm in length (see picture 5). With seal downward, place in the loaf tin. Repeat this step with the rest of the dough. Let proof in the tins, covered with cling wrap (see picture 6). The best temperature for 2nd round proofing is 38C, humidity 85%.",
    "When the dough rises and almost reaches to the rim of the load tins, lightly brush the surface with whisked egg. Bake in a pre-heated 180C (356F) oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until turns brown. Remove from the oven and transfer onto a wire rack. Let cool completely."
