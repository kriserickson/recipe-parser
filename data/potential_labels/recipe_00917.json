    "Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and grease a 9 by 13 by 2-inch baking pan.",
    "For the crust, cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer until light. Combine the flour, thyme and salt and, with the mixer on low, add to the butter until just mixed. Dump the dough onto a well-floured board and gather into a ball. Flatten the dough with floured hands and press it into the greased baking ban, building up a 1/2-inch edge on all sides. Chill.",
    "Bake the crust for 15 to 20 minutes, until very lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. Leave the oven on.",
    "For the lemon layer, whisk together the eggs, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and flour. Pour over the crust and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or about five minutes beyond the point where the filling is set. Cool to room temperature.",
    "For the lemon glaze, whisk together the confectioner's sugar and lemon juice. Add more or less sugar and/or juice for desired consistency. Pour glaze over lemon bars and spread with a spatula to cover evenly. Allow the glaze to set for at least 20-30 minutes. Cut into squares and garnish with fresh thyme, if desired. Serve and enjoy!"
