    "1. In a bowl, combine the rolled oats, natural peanut butter, honey and dark chocolate chips.",
    "2. Mix thoroughly until fairly consistent.",
    "3. Use a muffin tin as the mold to form the cookies.",
    "4. Place them in the fridge for an hour or so to allow them to harden and then eat immediately.",
    "TIP: It makes about eight 250-calorie cookies -- so one tin is more than enough. Tip: To cut down on calories, you can make 16 cookies instead."
