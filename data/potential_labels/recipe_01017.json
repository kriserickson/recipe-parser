    "Drain and rinse the beans in a colander in the sink.",
    "Return the empty pot to the stove and on medium-low heat, warm the vegetable oil. Add onions and carrots to pot and cook until onions are translucent, stirring occasionally, ~8 minutes. Add garlic and cook another 30 seconds.",
    "Return beans to the pot along with the chipotles and half of the cilantro. Cover with 2\" water, bring to a boil, then turn heat down to low and simmer uncovered for ~1½ hours.",
    "Add remaining cilantro, cumin, tomato paste, and lime juice. Season to taste with salt. Cook uncovered for another 30 minutes, or until beans are tender all the way through (will vary depending on the freshness of your beans). When done, smash a few beans against the side of the pot with a spoon to thicken, if you wish. Stir and serve."
