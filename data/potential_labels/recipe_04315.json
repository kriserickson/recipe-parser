    "Wash the leeks well and pat dry. In a large saucepan, heat 1/2 inch of oil until shimmering. Add all but 1/2 cup of the leeks and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the leeks to a paper towelâ€“lined plate. Discard the oil. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "In a large, deep skillet, cook the bacon over moderately high heat, turning once, until golden, about 5 minutes. Drain the bacon on paper towels and crumble.",
    "Add the remaining 1/2 cup of leeks and the thyme to the fat in the skillet and cook over moderately low heat until the leeks are softened, about 8 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the Rich Turkey Stock and cook over moderate heat until it is reduced by half, about 7 minutes. Add the heavy cream and cook over moderately high heat until it is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in the peas, crumbled bacon and the remaining 1/2 cup of stock and bring to a boil. Discard the thyme sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Add the cornstarch mixture and cook until the sauce is slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the peas to a bowl and top with the crispy leeks just before serving."
