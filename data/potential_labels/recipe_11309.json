    "Directions",
    "Melt butter in a large enameled cast iron pot over medium heat. Add chopped cauliflower, carrots, celery and onion and season lightly with salt and pepper. Saute until veggies are slightly tender, about 6 minutes, stirring frequently. Add flour and garlic and cook mixture, stirring constantly, 2 minutes. While stirring, slowly add in chicken broth, then add bay leaf and season with salt and pepper to taste. Increase heat to medium-high and bring mixture to a boil, stirring frequently. Once it reaches a boil, reduce heat to a simmer (medium-low), cover pot with lid and allow to cook, stirring occasionally, until veggies are tender, about 10 - 15 minutes.",
    "Stir in milk and cream and cook until heated through. Remove bay leaf and serve soup warm topped with cheddar cheese, bacon and green onions.",
