    "In a food processor or with your hands plus or mix together all ingredients for the shortbread crust. The mixture should resemble a crumbly dough that when pressed together stays together. Press into a greased spring form pan and set aside.",
    "For the filling: Beat together the cream cheese, sugar and eggs for 2-3 minutes. Add in the vanilla extract and beat on medium low for another 2-3 minutes until the mixture is nice and smooth! Must be very smooth!",
    "Pour filling into the pan on top of the crust and bake at 350 for 20 minutes. Top with a piece of foil and bake for another 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool COMPLETELY.",
    "Meanwhile, make the icing. Mix together all ingredients until nice and smooth. Pour directly on top of the cheesecake and then using green, yellow and purple icing sugars make your design of choice. I chose to do the three colors in a circle so that when the cheesecake is sliced you still have all 3 colors on your slice. Refrigerate for 2 hours and serve cold."
