    "preparation:",
    "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.",
    "Peel then roughly chop the sweet potato into 1/2 inch pieces. Toss with 1 tablespoon of bacon fat, salt and pepper, then spread out over a baking sheet and bake for 35 minutes, stirring or tossing halfway through to ensure even cooking, until they’re golden brown.",
    "While the potatoes are cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the remaining bacon fat. Add the ground sausage, and start to break it up using a wooden spoon. Add the maple syrup, then turn to medium low heat and continue to cook until the meat has cooked through. Set aside.",
    "Once the potatoes are done, remove from oven and turn the oven down to 350 degrees F. Add the potatoes to the pork mixture, giving everything a good stir, then make 4-6 indentations into the mixture, depending on how many eggs you’re using, and crack an egg into each indentation.",
    "Place the skillet on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, until the whites have set and the yolks are still runny. Season with salt and pepper, garnish with fresh herbs, and serve immediately."
