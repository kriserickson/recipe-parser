    "Take the dried potatoes, and place in medium size bowl. pour boiling water over potatoes, stir to combine and cover with plastic wrap. Let Sit 12 minutes undisturbed.",
    "Working very gently with a wooden spoon or spatula, mix into the puréed potato a generous pinch of salt, the beaten eggs, pepper, and enough flour to make a smooth, soft and only slightly sticky dough. Do not knead the dough or it will become gummy, just mix the ingredients together as gingerly as you can.",
    "Form the dough into a ball and place it on a well floured surface.",
    "Break off a handful of the dough and roll that with both hands until you have a ‘rope’ about the thickness of your thumb.",
    "Cut this rope into 1 inch lengths.",
    "Place your gnocchi on a baking sheet with some semolina as you make them.",
    "Cook the gnocchi in a gently boiling well-salted water. They are done just as soon as they rise to the surface of the water.",
    "Transfer to an ice bath immediately until chilled. once chilled, toss very lightly in oil just to avoid sticking together."
