    "Step 1 - In a bowl, grate ginger and garlic and then add the soy sauce, sake or cooking wine and sugar. Cut chicken thighs into small, bite sized, even pieces and marinate in this mixture for about 30 minutes. If you marinate this overnight, just marinate it using 1 tablespoon of soy as the saltiness will draw out the moisture in the chicken-then add the rest of the soy sauce 30 minutes before cooking to add flavour. Drain pieces well and then in two lots, toss in the potato starch. I use a ziplock bag for this to make it less messy.",
    "Step 2 - Heat a deep fryer or a saucepan filled with 1 inch of oil to 180C/350F. I use a sugar thermometer or you can place a small piece of bread in the oil to test when you think it will be ready. Fry the pieces for about 5 minutes being careful not to overcrowd them as that will cause the temperature of the oil to drop. Cook until they turn a golden bronzed colour. Drain on paper towels and serve hot."
