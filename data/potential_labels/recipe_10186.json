    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add a few tablespoons of salt. Cook until pasta is al dente. When the pasta is done cooking, pour the peas into the pot. Stir and drain pasta and peas and set aside.",
    "Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium heat melt butter. Add flour and whisk for 2 -3 minutes to cook out the 'floury' taste. Add Italian seasoning, garlic, rosemary, and salt. Whisk to combine.",
    "Add 2 cups of milk and continue to whisk, allow the sauce to thicken.",
    "Add cheeses and whisk until combined. Add lemon zest and stir. When cheese is completely melted, continue stirring until the sauce is thick and creamy.",
    "Pour cheese mixture over pasta and peas, stir in diced chicken. Add remaining cup of milk and mix well. Pasta thickens as it sits.",
    "Serve and enjoy!",
    "DONNA'S NOTES: You can leave out the lemon and rosemary if you prefer to simplify the recipe. Rotisserie chicken is excellent in this recipe."
