    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 6- to 8- quart pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Season the ribs with ¾ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Cook, in batches, until brown on all sides, 14 to 16 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.",
    "Add the onion and thyme to the pressure cooker. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 15 seconds. Add the wine and cook until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the broth.",
    "Nestle the ribs in the cooking liquid. Top with the potatoes. Secure the lid and bring to high pressure over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 45 to 50 minutes. Release the pressure and remove the lid. The ribs and potatoes should be tender.",
    "Transfer the potatoes to a medium bowl. Add the milk, butter, and ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper to the bowl and mash. Meanwhile, toss together the parsley, lemon zest, and the remaining oil. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Serve the potatoes warm, topped with the ribs and parsley relish."
