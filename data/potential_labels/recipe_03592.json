    "While blender is off, add a little olive oil, cover the blender with the lid, blend to combine. Pause the blender, add a little more olive oil, and continue until all the oil is well blended into the dressing. Some recipes recommend you pour the olive oil in while the blender is running, but mine is too powerful that I would have ended up with dressing on the ceiling. I recommend being safe and stopping your blender between each addition.",
    "Serve over spinach, with a taco salad, over rice or quinoa. Or just eat it straight out of the jar. I won't mind."
