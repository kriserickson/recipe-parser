    "Ingredients",
    "2 1/2 cups milk",
    "1 1/2 cups butter (melted)",
    "1 cup sugar",
    "1 tsp. salt",
    "2 tsp. cardamom (freshly ground from about 25 cardamom pods)",
    "2 pkg. dry active yeast (4 1/2 tsp.)",
    "8-9 cups flour (all-purpose or bread flour)​",
    "Steps to Make It",
    "Heat milk to a light boil, turning off heat when it reaches the scalding point (with small bubbles across the top).",
    "Stir in melted butter, sugar, salt, and ground cardamom. Let mixture cool until “finger-warm” (still quite warm, but just cool enough to touch).",
    "Stir in yeast and let sit for 10 minutes.",
    "Add flour into mixture 1/2 cup at a time until dough is firm and pulls away from the side of your mixing bowl (Tip: If using a stand mixer, exchange the mixing paddle for the dough hook after you’ve added the first 5 cups of flour. Use the dough hook to mix and knead the dough as you add the remaining 3-4 cups of flour).",
    "Cover the dough in the mixing bowl with a clean towel and let rise until doubled, about an hour.",
    "Punch down the dough, then remove from bowl.",
    "On a floured counter, knead dough lightly until smooth and shiny.",
    "Divide dough into two halves and use to make braided loaves (vetebröd), buns, and/or cinnamon rolls (kanelbullar)."
