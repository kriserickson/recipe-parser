    "In a large bowl, use your hands to combine all crisp topping ingredients. It will be a bit sandy in texture, but try to work it until it starts to form small clumps. Refrigerate the topping for at least 30 minutes, up to overnight. When ready to use, rework the topping with your hands, again trying to form some small clumps. (Not Klumps.)",
    "Preheat oven to 350. In a large bowl combine all crisp filling ingredients. Add the filling to single serving ramekins and top with a few tablespoons of the crisp topping. Bake for 30 minutes or until the apple filling begins to bubble and the topping browns. Serve warm with or without ice cream/coconut bliss/whatever your heart desires!",
