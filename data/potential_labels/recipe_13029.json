    "Melt the ingredients. Place the peanut butter, coconut oil, and salt in a medium heatproof bowl. Find a pot with a mouth a few inches smaller than the bowl, and fill it with 2 inches of water. Place the pot over high heat and cook until it comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Nestle the bowl of peanut butter over the pot of simmering water and melt the peanut butter and coconut oil over this water bath; mix.",
    "Store the ribbon. Remove the bowl from the double boiler and let it cool to room temperature. Store peanut butter ribbon in an airtight container in your cupboard.",
    "Prepare the ribbon as an add in. To use the peanut butter ribbon in your ice cream, heat it just enough that it is fluid but not hot. This should be about 60°F. Pour the liquid peanut butter ribbon over freshly churned ice cream, let it harden, then continue to layer ice cream and peanut butter ribbon."
