    "Soften yeast in warm water. Stir in sugar, oil, salt and 4 cups flour. Beat well. Gradually add remaining 4-5 cups flour. turn out on a floured surface and knead until smooth. Invert a large bowl or stockpot over the dough to prevent its drying out and let the dough rest 15 minutes. Divide the dough into three parts. Shape each part into a loaf and place in an oiled or nonstick 9x5-inch baking pan. Cover tightly with foil and freeze immediately. After loaves are frozen, remove them from the pans. Wrap the frozen loaves tightly in plastic or foil and overwrap with a tightly closed plastic sack. Return them to the freezer. Use within a month. When ready to bake, unwrap and place in a well-greased 9x5-inch baking pan. Cover and let thaw and rise. It will take about 1 hour for the dough to thaw; it will take 1 to 2 hours for it to rise. Bake thawed and risen loaf in preheated 375 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on wire racks. Makes enough for 3 loaves."
