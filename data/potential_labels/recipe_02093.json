    "In a VERY large pot (preferably heavy bottomed) combine linguini, tomatoes, stock, hot sauce, onion, garlic, red and green peppers, red-pepper flakes, cilantro, oil, salt, cumin, chili powder, oregano, pepper, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat.",
    "Boil mixture, stirring and turning pasta frequently, until pasta is cooked and the sauce has nearly evaporated, about 11 minutes. It may look like a lot of sauce when you remove the pan from heat, but trust me, it will soak into the pasta! Remove cilantro sprigs if visible. Stir in the greek yogurt.",
    "Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with chopped cilantro and lime for squeezing. Serve at once!"
