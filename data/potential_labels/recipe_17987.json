    "Fold the spring roll wrappers up. Cut the spring roll wrappers into tiny strips using a pair of scissors. Cut them into shorter strips. Lay them on a flat surface. Wet your hands and form the shrimp paste into balls (about 1 tablespoon) and roll the shrimp balls onto the bed of spring roll strips.",
    "The spring roll strips will stick to the shrimp ball, as shown on the picture below.",
