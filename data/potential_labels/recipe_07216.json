    "Place flour, 6 tbsp. butter, and 1⁄4 tsp. salt in a bowl; rub flour and butter together until pea-size crumbles form. Add 1⁄4 cup ice-cold water; stir until dough forms. Transfer to a work surface; form into a flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap; chill for 1 hour. Meanwhile, heat syrup in a 2-qt. saucepan over medium heat until loose. Remove from heat; stir in remaining butter and salt, bread crumbs, cream, egg, and zest. Set filling aside.",
    "Heat oven to 375°. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into an 11″ circle; transfer to a 9″ fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. Trim excess dough; chill for 30 minutes. Prick bottom with a fork; cover with a sheet of parchment paper. Fill with dried beans; bake until crust is set, about 20 minutes. Remove paper and beans; bake until light brown, about 10 minutes. Pour filling into tart shell; bake until filling is just set, about 30 minutes."
