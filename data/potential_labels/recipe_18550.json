    "In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sherry, brown sugar, cornstarch, sriracha, and ginger. Set aside.",
    "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and peppers, and stir, cooking for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute more, stirring continuously. Add the zucchini and stir it around, cooking it for 2 minutes more. Add the baby corn and broccoli and cook for a couple of minutes, then, while the veggies are still firm, pour in the sauce.",
    "Stir the veggies in the sauce, cooking for 1 to 2 minutes more, or until the sauce is very thick. If it needs to be a little saucier, pour in 1/4 to 1/2 cup hot water and splash in a little more soy sauce. Serve over noodles or rice, with a sprinkling of sesame seeds.",
    "Tips: Prep all the veggies and make the sauce up to 24 hours ahead of time. Keep in separate containers in the fridge."
