    "Set oven to broil. Place an oven rack in the top third of your oven. Toss together the red pepper, carrot, edamame and olive oil in a bowl. Transfer to a baking sheet, and broil for 5-7 minutes, stirring/shaking the pan 3 times and checking frequently to keep the veggies from burning.",

    "After the 10 minutes are up, slice each tofu slab lengthwise again so you have 4 pieces total. Slice each piece down the middle, creating 2 columns, and then slice so you have 4 rows. Place the tofu pieces in a bowl.",
    "Whisk together the sesame oil and tamari. Pour over the tofu and gently fold in. Sprinkle in the sesame seeds and fold again. Dust the cornstarch over the tofu and stir until fully incorporated.",
    "Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, stirring halfway through, until golden.",
    "To make the dressing, simply combine all ingredients in a blender, and process until smooth. Set aside.",
    "Toss together the broiled veggies with the romaine, cilantro, green onion and cashews. Transfer into individual bowls, and top with the sesame tofu. Drizzle with the dressing."
