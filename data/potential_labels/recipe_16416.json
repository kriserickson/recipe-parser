    "Whisk the eggs in a bowl until they're about half mixed, but there are still some white areas remaining.",
    "In a small frying pan about the diameter of the bowl you plan to serve your Oyakodon in, add the dashi, sake, soy sauce, sugar, and onions, breaking up any clumps of onion as you add them.",
    "Bring the dashi to a simmer and cook until the onions are almost tender (about 3 minutes)",
    "Add the chicken and cook until the chicken is cooked through (about 4 minutes).",
    "Drizzle the egg over the chicken in a figure eight pattern to ensure it's evenly distributed.",
    "Turn down the heat, and then cover and steam the eggs for 1-2 minutes or until they are you done to your liking. As the egg steams, smack the bottom of the pan against the burner a few times to redistribute the eggs so that they cook evenly.",
    "Add one serving of rice to a large bowl while the egg steams. When the egg is done, slide the chicken and egg onto the rice. Garnish your Oyakodon with scallions or mitsuba and shichimi togarashi to taste."
