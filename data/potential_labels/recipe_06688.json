    "Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add broccoli and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned in spots, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and chili flakes. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add wine and cook until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until broccoli is completely tender and broken down, about 1 hour. Season to taste with salt.",
