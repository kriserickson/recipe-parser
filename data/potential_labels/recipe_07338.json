    "Put the vinegar, orange peel and juice, sugar and spices in a small saucepan, bring to a boil on a medium-high heat and leave to bubble for three to four minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and there is only about 60ml of liquid left in the pan. Strain into a small bowl, then stir in the currants, barberries and onion. Set aside to cool for 30 minutes, stirring a few times, then transfer to a serving bowl with all the remaining ingredients. Add a third of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, toss again, and serve."
