    "Recipe Directions",
    "1. Break up an entire head of cauliflower into florets. Your sizes will vary, but think popcorn sized. :) Place florets into a huge bowl.",
    "2. Place all remaining ingredients on top of the cauliflower florets and stir gently and for quite a while to ensure that all of the florets are coated with the craycray delicious flavours.",
    "3. Line two dehydrator trays with parchment paper. Gently place the coated florets onto the parchment-paper lined trays.",
    "4. Dehydrate for an hour on high (140 degrees F). Then lower the temperature to 110F for another 8-10 hours. Florets will crisp up and shrink about half in size.",
    "5. Eat immediately, preferably in front of the TV while watching a good movie!"
