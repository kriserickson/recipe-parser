    "In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and yeast. Stir until evenly mixed. Add two cups of water. Stir it until it forms a ball of dough and there is no more dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl. Add a little bit more water if needed. It is okay for the dough to be wet and sticky. Loosely cover the dough and let it rest for 8 to 16 hours at room temperature.",
    "When you’re ready to make the pizza, cover two 10×15″ baking sheets with foil, give them a light dusting of non-stick spray and then sprinkle with the cornmeal. Begin preheating the oven to 425 degrees.",
    "Dust the top of the dough in the bowl heavily with flour. Also liberally dust your work surface with flour. Scoop the dough out of the bowl and onto the floured surface. Dust with more flour as needed. Cut the dough into two and stretch into rectangles to fit the baking sheets.",
    "Smear half of the jar of pesto on each dough. Sprinkle 1.5 cups of the shredded cheese on each. Thinly slice the roma tomatoes and divide them between the pizzas. Once the oven is FULLY preheated, add the pizzas. Bake until the crust is golden brown on the edges and the cheese is bubbly."
