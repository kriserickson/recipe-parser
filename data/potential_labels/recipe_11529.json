    "In the bowl of food processor fitted with the grating attachment, add the onions and pulse until shredded. Remove to a colander lined with a towel or cheesecloth over a large bowl to catch the excess liquid or use a hand grater.",
    "Add the potatoes to the food processor and pulse until shredded or use a hand grater. Remove the potatoes to the colander with the onions. Squeeze out excess liquid with the towel.",
    "Remove the potato mixture to a large bowl and add the eggs, matzo meal, baking powder and salt. Quickly mix before it turns brown. Fill cupcake tins halfway.",
    "Using a teaspoon, drizzle tops with olive oil and bake for 25-30 minutes, until tops are golden. Once cooled, pop them out onto paper-towel lined plates. Serve with applesauce, cream cheese with maple syrup, mango chutney and sour cream with red horseradish.",
