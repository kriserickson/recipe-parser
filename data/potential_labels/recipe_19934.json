    "Heat a large saute pan on medium heat. Add the bacon and saute until golden and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the bacon to a paper towel or small bowl.",
    "Add the diced onion and red bell pepper to the pan and saute for one minute to soften.",
    "Add the diced sweet potato and spices to the pan. Cook the sweet potato for 10-12 minutes, stirring often. Place a lid on the pan for the last 5 minutes to soften the sweet potato until fork tender.",
    "Add the bacon back into the pan along with the kale and stir for an additional 1-2 minutes or until the kale is wilted.",
    "Use a spatula to create 4 wells in the hash. Crack an egg into each well and cook until the eggs are done to your liking. You can add a lid to the pan to cook the eggs through faster.",
    "Remove the breakfast hash from the heat. Season with salt and pepper and top with sliced green onion. Serve immediately."
