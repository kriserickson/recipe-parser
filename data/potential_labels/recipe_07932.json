    "Heat the coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and leek, sauté for 3-4 mins until translucent and lightly browned. Add the pumpkin, stock, and water. Bring to the boil and then continue to simmer for 30 minutes until the pumpkin has softened.",
    "Remove the pot from the stove. Remove 1 cup of liquid from the pot and reserve it for later. Blend the remaining soup using a stick blender until smooth and creamy. You could also blend the soup in a blender, however you may need to do a few batches.",
    "Add the coconut cream and stir through. If the soup is still too thick for your liking, add the remaining liquid your reserved earlier and blend once more.",
    "Garnish with fresh parsley and a drizzle of coconut cream to serve."
