    "Spread sauce evenly across the tortilla, leaving ½ inch around the edges. Sprinkle with cheese and toppings.",
    "Bake until the cheese is golden and bubbling (no sooner!) and the edges of the tortilla are lightly browned, about 10 to 14 minutes. Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing."
