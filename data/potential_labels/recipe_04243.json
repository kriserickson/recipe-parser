    "Directions",
    "1. Drain and rinse the beans, transfer to a large bowl and mash. Set aside.",
    "2. Grate the zucchini and chop the scallion. Heat the oil in a frying pan or skillet and add the zucchini, scallion, oregano, thyme, season generously and allow to cook for several minutes until the zucchini softens.",
    "Finely chop the flat leaf parsley.",
    "3. Add the zucchini mixture to the mashed beans, season and combine using a spatula. Add the parsley, flour, polenta, pumpkin seeds and season further with lots of cracked black pepper. Mix until it comes together in a ball. If it is still quite sticky add a little more polenta.",
    "4. Take a handful, roll it into a large ball and then flatten ensuring there are no cracks around the rim of the patties.",
    "5. Repeat - you should get four or five decent sized patties out of this mix. Refrigerate for an hour turning over half way through.",
    "6. Heat a small amount of oil in the pan - I brush it evenly over the entire pan using a pastry brush. When it is a fairly high heat (but not smoking) add the patties and cook for 10 minutes on each side. Their exterior should be golden and crunchy."
