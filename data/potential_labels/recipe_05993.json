    "Using a handheld mixer, cream the peanut butter, sugar, salt, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Add 1 cup of half-and-half and beat on low speed until well mixed. Add the rest of the half-and-half and the cream and whisk by hand—if you try to use your mixer you will end up with it splattering all over the kitchen. Bring Mixture to a simmer, stirring to completely dissolve sugar. Chill in cooler at least 1 hour.",
    "Pour the mixture into ice cream maker and process for 25 to 30 minutes, or according to the manufacturer's directions.",
    "The ice cream will be on the soft side but can be eaten right away or put into the freezer to \"cure\" or harden up for a couple hours. Stored in an airtight container, the ice cream will keep at least a week in the freezer.",
