    "Cut chicken into bite-size pieces and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon coriander and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, stirring, until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate.",
    "Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, onion and ginger to the pan and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add sweet potato, tomatoes and their juice, peanut butter, 1 tablespoon lime juice, cayenne (or crushed red pepper) and the remaining 1 teaspoon coriander and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sweet potato is tender, 14 to 16 minutes. Return the chicken and any accumulated juice to the pan and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes more.",
    "Meanwhile, bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in couscous and the remaining 1 tablespoon lime juice. Cover, remove from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork; stir in cilantro. Serve the stew over the couscous."
