    "Directions",
    "Season the pork shoulder all over with 1 teaspoon of the salt. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium- high heat. Add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the turnips, and sear them on all sides, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add the pork and garlic, and brown the pork well on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the vinegar, bring to a boil, and reduce the liquid by about half. Add the white wine, cider, rosemary, sage, and 2 cups of water. Bring to a simmer, and season with remaining teaspoon of salt. Cover, and simmer until the pork is beginning to become tender, about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Uncover, add turnips, and cover again. Cook until the turnips and the pork are very tender, about 45 minutes more, uncovering for the last 5 to 10 minutes to reduce the sauce to a glaze. The pork shoulder can be sliced or shredded. Serve with the turnips and pan juices."
