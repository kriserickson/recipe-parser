    "Butter or oil an 8” x 11” baking pan. If you have a different size pan, that’s fine—it’ll just change how thick the bars are.",
    "Pour the oats into a large bowl. You can use quick oats",
    "if they’re all you have, but I prefer the bite and chew of rolled oats. For a different texture, you can also substitute a cup of oats with a cup of Rice Krispies, but",
    "the bars are great either way.",
    "Add the peanut butter, half the jelly, the water, and the salt to a small pan. Stir over low heat until it’s smooth.",
    "Mix the peanut butter and jelly concoction into the oats until all the oats are coated and you have a sticky mass.",
    "Dump the mixture into the oiled pan and press it into an even layer. Spread the remaining jelly over the top.",
    "Pop the pan into the oven for 25 minutes, until it’s toasty and brown around the edges. Mmm. Crunchy.",
    "Leave the bars in the pan until they cool completely, about an hour, then slice into 12 bars."
