    "Heat a wok or a heavy skillet over medium high heat until very hot. Add the oil, garlic and chilies and stir fry until until the garlic is very fragrant. Add the shallots (or onions) and continue stir frying until the onions have wilted. Add the ground chicken and fry until the chicken is cooked.",
    "Stir in the fish sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar and white pepper. (I'd add the white pepper in gradually - it can easily overpower if you add too much!) If your pan was hot enough you should not have any liquid at the bottom of the pan, but if you do, continue cooking until the liquid is gone. Add the basil and toss a couple of time until the leaves are wilted and bright green.",
    "Serve immediately."
