    "HOW TO MAKE IT",
    "Preheat oven to 350°F.",
    "In a skillet, cook the chorizo until almost done, drain well.",
    "Add the poblano and onion and cook until tender. Completely remove pan from heat.",
    "Carefully add tequila. Return to heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 20 seconds or until most of the tequila has dissipated.",
    "In a medium casserole or glass dish, stir the cheese with chorizo, peppers and onions. Bake uncovered about 10-15 minutes or until cheese is melted through and slightly golden brown on top. Sprinkle with tomato and cilantro. Serve with tortillas.",
    "*If you want to double the recipe, do not double the tequila. Continue to use only ½ cup."
