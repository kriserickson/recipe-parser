    "In a large saucepan, heat about a tablespoon of neutral oil over medium high heat until shimmering, add the onion and turn the heat to medium and cook until the onion gets browned in spots, about 3-5 minutes. Add the carrots, garlic, ginger, and crushed red pepper flakes and cook for another 5 minutes or so, stirring frequently. Add the stock, soy sauce or tamari, lime juice, peanut butter, brown or palm sugar, sesame oil, sriracha, and fish sauce (if using) and simmer until the carrots are tender and easily pierced with a knife, 15-20 minutes.",
    "Remove from heat, and puree the soup with a stick blender until smooth (you could also transfer to a regular blender and then return to the pan). Stir in the coconut milk and return to a simmer. Remove from heat"
