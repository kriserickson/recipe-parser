    "Instructions",
    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside.",
    "Grab three bowls. Add the flour to one bowl.",
    "Combine panko, 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, dried parsley, garlic powder, about 1/2 teaspoon each of salt (I use seasoned salt) and pepper. Stir.",
    "In the final bowl, add 1-2 teaspoons lemon zest, 4-5 tablespoons lemon juice (depending on lemon flavor intensity desired), minced garlic, and 5 tablespoons melted butter. Stir. Remove 4 tablespoons of this mixture and set aside.",
    "Slice chicken breasts to the size of tenders (about 1 and 1/4th inch strips) or use chicken tenders.",
    "Coat in flour, heavily dredge in garlic lemon mixture, and then coat in the Parmesan panko mixture.",
    "Place on prepared sheet pan. Use any remaining Parmesan panko mixture and sprinkle over tenders. Sprinkle lemon pepper seasoning over the tenders (I use Mrs. Dash lemon pepper)",
    "Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes and remove.",
    "Flip the tenders to the other side.",
    "Place the asparagus next to the tenders and drizzle the reserved lemon butter sauce. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese over the asparagus and toss with tongs.",
    "If desired place lemon slices over the chicken (optional)",
    "Return to the oven and bake for another 10-12 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken has reached 165 degrees F.",
    "Meanwhile, whisk remaining 3 tablespoons melted butter, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1-2 teaspoons lemon zest, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and 3 tablespoons honey in a small bowl. Add some pepper and parsley if desired.",
    "Remove from the oven and top with the honey lemon mixture and fresh parsley if desired and enjoy immediately.",
    "Do not top chicken breasts with the honey lemon mixture unless eating immediately and aren't planning on having leftovers since it will make it soggy.",

    "I should add that I made some extra pieces of chicken and didn’t use the honey lemon topping on them at the end for use in the salad (didn’t think the honey would be a good match there, and the chicken kept a nice texture). Then just cut them into bite sized pieces and tossed them in. Would be good slightly warm or cold in a Caesar salad. Perfect either way.",

    "Hi..I want to try this recipe for my husband…it’s his birthday and wanted to try something special and different for dinner …only problem I might not be able to get the panko…we live in the island and don’t have a wide variety of stuff…is there anything I could use as a substitute for the Panko that would end up having the same effect",

The only thing I added was a little Thyme to the panko mixture and a little in the melted butter mixture, along with some half-sauteed mushrooms to sprinkle in on the second 10-12 minutes for an extra element. Fantastic meal! The whole house loved it! I will definitely be making this again.",

I left off the honey lemon sauce because we’re not fans of sweet sauces. Maybe it makes it even more delciious but I can’t imagine how you can improve on the basic recipe. Amazing!
