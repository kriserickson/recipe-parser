    "In a small food processor or mixing bowl, combine butter, bourbon, honey, garlic, and chipotle. Stir or pulse until well-mixed. You can make the butter mixture up to 1 week in advance and refrigerate until ready to serve. If you’re going to be cooking in the hot sun, make sure to chill the butter until solid before starting, about 1 hour.",
    "When ready to BBQ, fire up grill or broiler. Remove butter from the fridge and place a scant tablespoon on each shucked oyster. Place the oysters on the grill or transfer to a baking sheet and place under the broiler. Once the oysters and butter have bubbled and caramelized, remove them from the grill or broiler, about 3 minutes. Let cool slightly before enjoying (the shells will be very hot). Eat immediately!",
    "Notes:\n1. You’ll have an easier time incorporating the bourbon into the butter if you use a food processor. But you can just as easily spoon the butter mixture onto the oysters a bit lumpy–it’s going to melt anyway!\n2. If you’re broiling the oysters instead of grilling, use small piles of salt under each shell to keep them upright, otherwise the butter will spill all over the pan."
