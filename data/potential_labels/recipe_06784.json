    "Combine the quinoa, 2 tablespoons of the oil, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan and parsley.",
    "Meanwhile, steam the cauliflower in 1/2 inch water until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Pulse the cauliflower, cream, butter, and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a food processor until finely pureed, 30 seconds to 1 minute.",
    "Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the steaks with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest steak registers 130Â° F, 2 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let rest for 5 minutes; thinly slice against the grain.",
    "Serve the steak and quinoa over the puree."
