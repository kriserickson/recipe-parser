    "Pull all meat from the chicken and put in a large bowl. This will feel barbaric.\nEmbrace it. I remove the skin as well. Then, with two forks, shred the meat into little bite-size bits.",
    "Add yogurt and pesto, and mix. Then mix in both kinds of peas.",
    "Pile chicken salad on thick slices of toast, stuff into a pita, scoop onto greens, or use as a filling for lettuce wraps. Your roommate will make this into a sandwich when she gets home from work. You will eat leftovers from the bowl tomorrow with a fork. You will spend your day thinking about how to eat it next. This is your life now."
