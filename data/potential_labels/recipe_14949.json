    "You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes.",
    "Or you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200°F oven for 10 minutes.",
    "2 Put plums, sugar, orange, lemon, and raisins into a large 6 or 8-quart pan. Heat until boiling. Gently boil for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the mixture starts to thicken slightly. Stir in walnuts.",
    "3 Carefully ladle the conserve into the jars, one at a time, leaving 1/4 inch head space at the top of the jars for a vacuum seal.",
    "Wipe the rim clean with a clean, wet paper towel. Place the lid on the jar, securing with a jar ring.",
    "Allow the jars to sit overnight. You will hear them make a popping sound as a vacuum seal is created."
