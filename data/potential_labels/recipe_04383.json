    "When the sauce starts to thicken up, use a small ladle and scoop some of the water from the pasta and add it to the sauce. Start with about a quarter cup. Stir it in and let it cook down a little bit. Keep doing this until you reach the consistency of sauce that you want (should be between 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup liquid).",
