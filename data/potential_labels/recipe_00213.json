    "In a medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a simmer, and then whisk in 1 cup coarse cornmeal until it begins to thicken, about 1 minute. Reduce to medium low and cook until thick, whisking frequently, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, season two bone-in pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet on medium and sear the chops until cooked through, about 5 minutes on each side. When the polenta is done, stir in 1 cup thawed squash puree, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, and a drizzle of pure maple syrup. Add salt and pepper to taste."
