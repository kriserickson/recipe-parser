    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Melt butter in large pan, add vanilla. Blend in sliced and peeled peaches and toss to coat. Add sugars, spices, salt and lemon zest. Cook over medium heat until peaches are soft and liquid is reduced. Remove from heat and strain peaches.",
    "Unroll premade pie crust and press with rolling pin to stretch. Using a small bowl (approx. 4 inches wide) cut out circles from the pie crusts to yield about 14 circles. Fill circles with 1 tablespoon of peach mixture in the middle, being careful not overfill. Fold circle over to create a filled semi-circle and press edges to seal and make decorative edge with the back of a fork. Continue process until all hand pies are completed.",
