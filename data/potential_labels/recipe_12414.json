    "Preheat oven to 400ºF. Combine corned beef, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese in a medium mixing bowl. Be sure to trim any excess fat off of the corned beef.",
    "To fill the egg rolls, add ¼ cup of filling to the center of the roll. Fold in one corner, lightly wet it by dipping your finger in water, and fold over a second and a third corner. Lightly wet the folded corners again, and then roll the egg roll towards the fourth corner to form a roll.",
    "Place each spring roll on a lightly greased baking sheet and lightly brush each one with vegetable oil. Bake in a 400ºF oven for 10–12 minutes, or until golden brown. Best served immediately with Russian or Thousand Island dressing."
