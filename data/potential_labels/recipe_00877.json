    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease an 8x8 inch square baking pan, and set aside. (Note: a 9x11 works fine, too!)",
    "In a medium bowl, stir together uncooked quinoa, cinnamon, and allspice to coat quinoa with spices. Pour quinoa over bottom of prepared pan.",
    "In the same bowl used for the quinoa, beat the eggs until fully mixed. Whisk in the milk and maple syrup, and beat to combine.",
    "Scatter the berries, apple or pear pieces, and nuts (if using) evenly on top of the quinoa.",
    "Pour the egg and milk mixture over the top of the fruit and quinoa. Lightly stir to partially submerge the fruit. (The milk mixture will cook the quinoa to create a very soft texture on the inside, while creating a lightly crunchy crust on the outside!)",
    "Bake for 1 hour, or until casserole is mostly set with only a small amount of liquid left. Serve warm, and refrigerate leftovers."
