    "In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine 1 packet of instant rise yeast, ¼ cup of dried non-fat milk, about 15 grams of sugar, 1 ½ cups of warm water and 1 tsp of kosher salt.",
    "Mix together and let it get a little foamy for 3-5 minutes before adding 500g of all purpose flour and 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil. Knead mixture with a dough hook on medium high speed for 5-8 minutes before a tacky ball of dough forms.",
    "Flour your countertop and turn the dough out on top. Pat and stretch to a 9x13 inch rectangle. Add ⅓ cup of vegetable oil to a casserole dish and place your dough inside. Pat it into the corners until it fills the casserole dish and cover with plastic wrap.",
    "Set aside and let it rise for 60-90 minutes or until it has doubled in size.",
    "Leave the dough in the casserole dish, cut into one inch sticks, (about the size of the ones you’d get at Pizza Hut) and spray with butter flavored Pam.",
    "In a small bowl combine the onion powder, garlic powder, dried oregano, dried basil, ground pepper, kosher salt, and parmesan cheese. Mix all of those together and cover the top of the breadsticks.",
    "Place in a 475° F oven for 15-20 minutes."
