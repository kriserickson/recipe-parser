    "To make the dressing and chips. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.",
    "In a medium size bowl or glass measuring cup, combine the ginger, garlic, minced red chile peppers, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, honey, sesame oil and fish sauce (you will add the peanut butter to the dressing later). Whisk well. Arrange the wontons in a single layer on the baking sheet (you may need 2 baking sheets). Brush each wonton with a thinish coating of the dressing and then sprinkle sesame seeds over the crackers. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the chips are crisp and golden. Remove from the oven and repeat with another batch if needed.",
    "Whisk the peanut butter into the remaining dressing. If needed thin with 1-2 tablespoons water. Set aside until ready to serve.",
    "In a medium size bowl combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, lime juice, curry powder, and garlic. Whisk to combine and add the chicken, toss well. Heat a skillet to medium high heat and add the chicken and all the liquids. Brown the chicken for about 6 minutes on both sides or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has reduced. Remove from the heat allow to cool and then slice into strips. You may also grill the chicken if desired.",
    "In a large bowl combine the chicken vermicelli noodles, avocado, carrots, bell peppers, chopped lettuce, green onions, basil, mint and cilantro, lemongrass, sesame seeds and cashews. Lightly toss and add the dressing, toss again, divide the salad among bowls and serve with the hoisin sesame chips. EAT right away. You can also create and assembly line of ingredients and create your own salads."
