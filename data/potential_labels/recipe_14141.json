    "Stand at room temperature 15-30min (depending on your patience)",
    "Pour a little into a pre-heated, non-stick frypan and immediately tip the frypan to let the batter spread all over the frypan (can use a regular frypan, greased with a tiny bit of butter) (another option is to spread the batter with a crepe tool or teppanyaki/okonomiyaki spatula) Cook over med-high heat until underside is golden-brown. (about 2 min)",
    "Lift the edges of the crepe and flip the crepe (I find this easiest to do with my fingers, as the crepe is so thin) Cook just 30 sec or so on the second side.",
    "Fill the Crepes however you like."
