    "Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown lamb shanks on all sides, about 2 minutes per side or until a dark brown colour. Remove from pot. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and curry paste and rub lamb shanks with two-thirds of the curry mixture, reserving the remainder. Season shanks with salt.",
    "Turn heat to low and add more oil if needed. Add onions and cook slowly for 10 minutes or until soft but barely coloured. Add ginger, garlic, garam masala and remaining curry mixture and sauté for 2 minutes or until fragrant.",
    "Add stock, tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, sugar and orange peel and bring to a boil. Return shanks to pot, cover and bake for 1 hour. Turn meat, cover and bake 30 minutes longer; turn again, uncover and bake 30 minutes or until lamb is very tender and sauce is rich. Skim fat from sauce and remove orange peel. If sauce is too thin, remove shanks and bring sauce to a boil over high heat. Reduce until sauce is slightly thickened. Sprinkle with coriander before serving."
