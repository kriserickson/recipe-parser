    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "Heat a large soup pot over medium-high heat. When hot, add the olive oil and diced yellow onion. Stir the onion occasionally and cook until sweating and starting to become opaque.",
    "Stir in the minced garlic, diced fresh fennel and crushed coriander seed and cook for 2-3 minutes more.",
    "Add the pasta sauce, water, coconut milk, balsamic vinegar, black pepper and salt. Cook for 10 minutes, until just starting to boil. Cut off the heat.",
    "Use a metal immersion blender on low-power to blend everything together in the pot until creamy â€” this marries all of that delicious onion, garlic, fennel flavor with the tomato sauce.",
    "Serve hot, with a swirl of coconut cream and fresh herbs to garnish!"
