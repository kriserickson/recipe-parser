    "For the Remoulade Sauce: Prepare sauce by combining all sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Refrigerate covered for 1 hour while flavors meld.",
    "For the burgers: In a large mixing bowl, combine ground pork, Cajun seasoning, scallions, hot sauce, and salt and pepper, to taste. Wet your hands to prevent sticking and shape into 4 patties slightly larger than the size of the buns. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in refrigerator if not cooking immediately.",
    "Set up grill for direct cooking over medium heat. Oil grate when ready to start cooking. Place burgers on hot oiled grill and cook 5 to 6 minutes per side or until desired doneness. Serve hot on toasted buns with lettuce, tomato, onions, and a dollop of the Remoulade Sauce.",
    "INDOOR: Prepare burgers as directed. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. When oil is hot add burgers and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side or until done.",
