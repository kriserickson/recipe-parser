    "In a small bowl or glass measuring cup, whisk together the honey, whole grain mustard, dijon, and garlic. Taste and season with salt and pepper.",
    "Pat the thighs dry with a paper towel and season generously with salt and pepper. Heat up a large cast iron pan or non-stick skillet on medium high heat and add 4 of the thighs skin side down. Brown for 5 minutes undisturbed until golden and crispy. Remove from the pan and place in a large oven-proof casserole dish. Brown the remaining 4 thighs and place in the oven-proof dish. Top with the quartered shallots and pour on the honey mustard mixture. Bake until the thighs are cooked through, 30-40 minutes based on size. Squeeze on some lemon juice (adds some brightness) and sprinkle with green onions (adds some freshness) if desired and enjoy warm!"
