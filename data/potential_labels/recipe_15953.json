    "Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Wash the sweet potatoes, then carefully slice them in half lengthwise. Place the halved sweet potatoes on a baking sheet, cut side up, and drizzle the olive oil over the cut open surfaces. Use your hands to rub the oil over the entire cut surface of the sweet potatoes. Flip the sweet potatoes over, so the cut side is facing down.",
    "Roast the sweet potatoes, cut side down, for 30 minutes, or until they are softened and slightly caramelized on the bottom.",
    "While the sweet potatoes are roasting, prepare the streusel topping. Add the flour, oats, sugar, walnuts, butter, and cinnamon to a bowl. Use your hands or a pastry cutter to mix the ingredients together until it forms a crumbly mixture with pea-sized pieces. Refrigerate the streusel until it's ready to be used.",
    "After roasting the sweet potatoes, remove them from the oven, but leave the oven on. Use a spatula to carefully flip the sweet potatoes over so the cut sides are facing up. Use a small sharp knife to carefully score crosshatched lines into the sweet potatoes.",
    "Drizzle about 1 tsp maple syrup over the scored surface of each sweet potato. Pile the prepared streusel over top of each potato, then bake for another 10 minutes in the hot oven, or until the streusel is crispy. Serve hot."
