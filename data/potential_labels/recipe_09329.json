    "Place all ice cream base into a freezer-safe container in the refrigerator for 2 hours to set up before freezing.",
    "Freeze the ice cream according to the manufacturer's instructions for your machine.",
    "No Machine/No Churn",
    "Place all ice cream base into a freezer-safe container and place in the freezer and allow to freeze for 1 hour. Ensure it is covered.",
    "Whisk slightly every 20 minutes to avoid it getting too icy for 3-4 hours. It should be getting thicker after each whisking, until it's firm enough to scoop.",
    "To eat: serve immediately or when you are ready for it (after it's been in the freezer), thaw for 5-10 minutes and scoop with an ice cream scoop.",
    "Notes",
    "This recipe is vegan and gluten free.",
    "*You can buy coconut cream or make it from full fat coconut milk. Place a can of coconut milk in the fridge overnight. Remove, turn upside down, open and pour off the liquid coconut water on top (you can drink it or use it in a smoothie). Then use the thick coconut cream that is left in the recipe."
