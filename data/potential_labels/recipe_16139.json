    "Rinse the sauerkraut under water in a strainer to wash juice off. Chop up the onion into small chunks. Place the pork knuckles or ham hocks into the crock pot. In a medium bowl, mix together sauerkraut, beef stock, beer, onions, juniper seed, bay leaves, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste together. Pour mixture over the pork. Cover and simmer for 8 hours. Remove lid and scoop out pork with the sauerkraut and serve."
