    "Season the duck legs and lightly rub with olive oil. Place on a baking tray and cook at 180˚C/gas mark 4 for 40 minutes.The idea is to have moist slow cooked duck and if the meat is not quite yet tender return to the oven for a further 10 minutes. Remove the legs from the oven and leave to rest for a few minutes",
