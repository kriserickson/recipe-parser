    "Prepare the jars: Wash the jar and lid with warm soapy water, rinse well, and dry before using.",
    "Prepare the vegetables: Peel the ginger with a small spoon. Thinly slice on a mandoline or with a knife. Thinly slice the radish, if using.",
    "Salt the ginger: Combine the ginger and salt in a small bowl. Set aside for 30 minutes.",
    "Fill the jar: Put the radish, if using, into jar. Add the ginger and pack tightly.",
    "Make the pickling brine: Combine the vinegar, water, and sugar in a small saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Pour the brine over the ginger, filling the jar to within 1/2 inch of the top. You might not use all the brine.",
    "Remove air bubbles: Gently tap the jar against the counter a few times to remove all the air bubbles. Top off with more pickling brine if necessary.",
    "Seal the jar: Seal the jar tightly.",
    "Cool and refrigerate: Let the jar cool to room temperature. Store the pickles in the refrigerator. The pickles will improve with flavor as they age â€” try to wait at least 48 hours before cracking them open."
