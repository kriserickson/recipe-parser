    "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and grease a 12 cup muffin pan lightly with coconut oil, or line with baking cups",
    "In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, coconut milk (already blended*) maple syrup and vanilla until very smooth",
    "In a separate bowl, combine the coconut flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and ginger.",
    "Stir the dry mixture into the wet until completely moistened. You will have a thick dough rather than a typical muffin batter.",
    "Lastly, stir in the shredded carrots and raisins to fully combine.",
    "Spoon the thick mixture into the muffin cups almost all the way up (they won't rise much at all) to make 10-12 muffins (for 12 they will be a bit smaller)",
    "Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.",
    "Remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.",
    "You can store any leftovers covered at room temperature or refrigerated for 3-4 days.",
    "Enjoy!",
    "Notes",
    "*Prior to using your coconut milk for this recipe, discard about half of the \"water\" from the can and blend the remaining thick part with the remaining watery part with an immersion blender or by hand with a whisk."
