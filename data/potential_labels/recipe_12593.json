    "Add half the sugar to a mixing bowl. Preheat oven to 160C",
    "Break 4 whole eggs plus 3 egg yolks and add to sugar.",
    "Place the milk in saucepan, place on stove at high heat until it boils.",
    "Slice vanilla bean in half and scrape all the seeds.",
    "Add the seeds to the egg mixture and the vanilla pods to the milk.",
    "Mix all ingredients by hand for 2 minutes.",
    "Once milk almost boils, combine it to the mixture while whisking fast.",
    "For the caramel, place the remainder of sugar in saucepan on high heat with a little water just enough to soak, about one quarter cup.",
    "Strain the mixture in a fine sieve to remove vanilla pod and any cooked egg lumps.",
    "Once the caramel starts to brown, shake the saucepan to mix evenly, don’t let it get too dark as it will get bitter. Pour into dariole or ramekin moulds. (Be very careful as caramel is super hot)",
    "Let the caramel cool down for 5 minutes then fill the moulds with the mixture.",
    "Place moulds in a large baking dish, fill dish with hot tap water (Bain Marie) half way up and place in oven for 40 minutes at 160C – 320F in convection oven.",
    "Once cooked, remove from oven and take moulds out of water for cooling. Leave to cool at least 2 hours, for best results one to two days in the fridge."
