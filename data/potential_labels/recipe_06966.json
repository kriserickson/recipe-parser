    "Add the spinach last. The heat will wilt it perfectly. You don't want to add it until last, so it doesn't become soggy.",
    "Squeeze juice from one lemon, if desired. Adding the fresh lemon juice really brightens up the warm flavors and eliminates the need for extra salt. Taste and add any additional salt though, if you desire."
