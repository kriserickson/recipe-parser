    "To make the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together shallot, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, honey then season with salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in oil until emulsified. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired. Makes about 1 cup of vinaigrette. Set aside.",
    "In a medium pan on medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add chopped kale and sauté until wilted, about 3 minutes. Add bag of cooked lentils and stir until heated through, about 3 more minutes. Remove from heat and place into a large bowl. Add quartered tomatoes then gently fold in 1/4 cup of vinaigrette. Taste and add more vinaigrette if needed. This dish is best served warm, but it can also be prepared a day in advance and served cold."
