    "Combine garlic, lemon juice, mustard, chickpea liquid, and chickpeas in a tall container just large enough to fit the head of an immersion blender. Blend at high speed until completely smooth. Alternatively, blend in the jar of a standard countertop blender. With the blender running, slowly drizzle in vegetable oil. A smooth, creamy emulsion should form.",
    "Using a rubber spatula, transfer to a bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mayonnaise will keep in a covered container in the fridge for up to 1 week."
