    "Preheat the oven to 400.",
    "First, we’ll roast the garlic. Cut off the top part of the garlic head so the cloves are visible, and peel off the excess outside layers, leaving a layer intact. Drizzle the top with 1 tsp olive oil, and wrap it loosely in aluminum foil.",
    "Place the garlic on a baking sheet and roast for 40 minutes. Allow it to cool before handling.",
    "Meanwhile, combine the rest of the ingredients for the sausage (except the coconut oil or ghee): the ground chicken, coconut sugar, onion powder and minced onion, basil, parsley, and sea salt.",
    "Once the garlic has baked and is cool enough to handle, mash up three cloves with a fork, and mix those into the sausage mixture.",
    "Use a cookie scoop to make meatball-sized mini sausages. Leave them in a ball shape.",
    "Heat a large cast iron skillet with the coconut oil or ghee. Once it’s hot, add the sausages, and press them down slightly with your hand to flatten them. Cook for 3-4 minutes on first side, and 2 mins on second side, or until cooked through."
