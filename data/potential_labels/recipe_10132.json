    "Cook in microwave for 1 minute 20 seconds, or until cake rises to the top, edges look set and center looks slightly wet and shiny, but not raw. It should stick slightly to your finger.",
    "Remove from microwave and carefully pipe in light chocolate pudding into the center. Place back in the microwave for 10 seconds. Cool for 5 minutes so you don’t burn your tongue. Dig in!"
