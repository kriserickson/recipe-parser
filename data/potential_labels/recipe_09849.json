    "Preparation",
    "Heat oven to 450° F. Toss the squash and onion with 1 teaspoon oil and salt on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast in a single layer until browned and soft, about 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Transfer the roasted vegetables to a large saucepan with the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, for 3-5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the broths, coconut milk and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 5 minutes.",
    "Remove bay leaf and transfer squash mixture to a blender. Puree until smooth.",
    "Pro Tip",
    "Speed up this recipe up by replacing fresh squash with two 12-ounce packages of frozen pureed butternut squash. Sauté the shallots and garlic for 3 minutes before adding thawed squash, broths, coconut milk, salt and the bay leaf."
