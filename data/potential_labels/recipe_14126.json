    "The Method:",
    "Preheat the oven to 375-degrees F.",
    "Heat the almond milk for 45 seconds in the microwave in a microwave safe bowl. Temperature should be warm to touch (warmth helps the yeast grow). Then, sprinkle yeast packet over the warm almond milk and set aside for 10 minutes.",
    "Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, and white sugar from \"For the Filling\" in a bowl. Set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, combine pizza crust mix and 1/4 cup sugar. Add in melted butter, eggs (one at a time), and yeast mixture. Blend until thoroughly mixed using a dough hook on your Kitchen Aid, with a handheld mixture on \"low\".Â (Try not to overtax, as this will make your rolls a bit tough.)",
    "Lay out a piece of wax paper, or clear a clean area of counter space. Drizzle 1/2 tbsp. melted coconut oil over a surface area of 16x9\" and get hands wet to work with dough. Lay out the dough and use a ceramic rolling pin to spread dough until it is roughly 1/2-3/4\" thick. Once dough is approximately 16\" in length and 9\" in width, drizzle 1-2 Tbsp. of the melted coconut oil over the upward facing surface area. Use a spoon to evenly sprinkle topping mixture over melted coconut oil, covering the entire surface area of dough.",
    "Carefully roll the dough at the long side until a \"log\" forms. Use a knife to cut the dough into 1-1/2\" pieces. Place cinnamon rolls in a prepared 8x8 pan and let them rise in a warm place, covered with a dry clean towel, for 30 minutes.",
    "Just before putting them into the oven, drizzle with an additional 1 tbsp. melted coconut oil.",
    "Bake for 22-24 minutes or until edges are golden brown.. When cooled, frost and enjoy!",
    "Frosting Options:",
    "For a simple homemade glaze, I combined 2 cups organic confectioners' sugar, 3 Tablespoons melted coconut oil, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 2 Tablespoons warm almond milk."
