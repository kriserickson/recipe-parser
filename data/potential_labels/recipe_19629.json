    "Preheat your waffle iron for about 5 minutes, until hot.",
    "If the recipe contains cream cheese, place it into a bowl first. Heat it gently in the microwave (~15-30 seconds) or a double boiler, until it's soft and easy to stir.",
    "Stir in all other remaining ingredients (except toppings, if any).",
    "Pour enough of the chaffle batter into the waffle maker to cover the surface well. (That's about 1/2 cup batter for a regular waffle maker and 1/4 cup for a mini waffle maker.)",
    "Cook until browned and crispy, about 3-4 minutes. (See my tip in the post above about other ways to tell they are done without opening the waffle maker!)",
    "Carefully remove the chaffle from the waffle maker and set aside to crisp up more. (Cooling is important for texture!) Repeat with remaining batter, if any."
