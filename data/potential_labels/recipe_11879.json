    "Place in oven and bake 80-90 minutes uncovered - check at 60 minutes to see how it is coming. If it is jiggly in the center it is not cooked, remove from oven once the center is set, it will still look wet but will not be very jiggly.",
    "If the top starts to becoming too browned lightly cover with a piece of tin foil."
