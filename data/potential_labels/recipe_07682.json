Refrigerate for 2-3 hours before using. When ready to use, roll out round large enough to fit your pie plate. Transfer to pie dish and crimp the edges as desired. Poke holes at the bottom of pie. Bake for 25-30 minutes until baked through and slightly golden. Remove and let cool before filling. If using a pie filling recipe that needs baked, bake according to that particular recipe.",
