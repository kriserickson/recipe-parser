  "ingredients": [
    "0",
    "3-4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil",
    "2 roma tomatoes (chopped—and you can buy these already chopped in most stores but they take so little time to chop that I rarely do that)",
    "2-3 scallions (chopped—the white and green parts—and, yes, I do often buy them already chopped and just freeze whatever I don’t use so I don’t waste my well-spent money)",
    "½ cup – 1 cup crumbled feta cheese (this is a taste issue—I have a cheese addict in my house—more cheese on anything means he will consume it)",
    "1-2 tablespoons Cavender’s All Purpose Greek seasoning (to suit YOUR taste—again, more is better)",
    "Italian or French bread that has been pre-sliced at the grocery store and lightly toasted or whatever crackers/crustini you can find in your pantry"
