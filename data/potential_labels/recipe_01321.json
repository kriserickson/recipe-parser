    "Heat oil in stockpot. Add shallots and garlic, and saute for 2 min. De-glaze with white wine and reduce by one half. Blend chicken base and 1/2 gallon water. Add to pot with heavy cream and bring to a boil slowly to avoid scorching. Blend cornstarch and 1/2 C. water; set aside. When cream mix reaches boiling point, whisk in cornstarch blend to thicken, whipping well. Reduce heat to low. Using vegetable peeler, remove the rind from the cheese. Shred and add to cream mix. Blend with a hand mixer until very smooth. Strain. If using immediately, keep sauce warm in a double boiler. Otherwise chill in ice bath and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Serve with chunks of grilled meat, roasted vegetables and crusty bread for dipping."
