    "Boil the sweet potatoes in a medium pot until tender, 20 to 30 minutes, depending on size of potatoes.",
    "When cool enough to handle, mash the potatoes in a potato riser or masher. (If you are using a masher, you will have to peel the potatoes first)",
    "Place the sweet potatoes in a large bowl and add in the glutinous rice flour, corn flour, sugar, grated coconut, and sea salt. Mix with your hand to get soft dough. Knead lightly to form a smooth dough.",
    "Pinch a small piece of dough (about 15 g each) roll them in your palm to form a smooth ball.",
    "Heat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy pan over low to moderate heat. Put in a cube of potato – when potato is nicely colored, the oil is hot enough to fry the sweet potato balls. Fry until golden, remove and drain on a paper towel. Serve immediately.",
    "Makes about 50 balls."
