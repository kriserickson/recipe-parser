    "To make your garlic butter shrimp: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. In a bowl, season shrimp with salt and pepper, to taste. Add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp is pink, about 2-3 minutes; then set aside in a shallow plate.",
    "Add garlic to the same skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken stock, hot sauce, and lemon juice to deglaze. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until reduced by half, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in remaining 6 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until melted and smooth.",
    "Stir in shrimp and gently toss to combine with the garlic butter sauce. Reheat for 1 minute, then serve the garlic butter shrimp immediately, garnished with chili pepper flakes and fresh chopped parsley, if desired. Enjoy"
