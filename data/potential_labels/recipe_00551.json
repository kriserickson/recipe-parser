    "Wash the arugula and trim off the tough roots if any. You should have 170 g after trimming. Toast the pine nuts on a pan over medium heat until lightly browned.",
    "Add arugula, Greek yogurt, grated Parmigiano cheese, toasted pine nuts, garlic, salt, black pepper and nutmeg in a food processor. Run until finely blended. Bring a large pot of water to boil with a big pinch of salt. Cook the pasta according to package instruction until al dente. Drain the pasta REALLY well and rid of any excess water. Toss with the arugula/yogurt pesto.",
    "Use a peeler to shave Parmigiano cheese over the top, and torn off small pieces of coppa/prosciutto to scatter on top. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and crack fresh black peppers. Serve warm or at room temperature."
