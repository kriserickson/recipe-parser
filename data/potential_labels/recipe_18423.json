    "Add soy sauce, brandy, brown sugar, cornstarch, sriracha, and ginger to a small mason jar or tupperware. Seal and shake well to combine. Set aside.",
    "Heat the oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat. Add the onion and peppers, and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30Â seconds more. Add the zucchini and Chinese eggplant, and cook for 2-3 minutes longer. Add the water chestnuts and broccoli and allow to cook for 1-2 minutes longer. The veggies should still be fairly firm.",
    "Add in the sauce, stir, and allow to heat through for 1-2 minutes, until the veggies are coated and the sauce thickened. If the sauce gets too thick, add in an additional splash of water.",
    "Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve over noodles or rice, if desired."
