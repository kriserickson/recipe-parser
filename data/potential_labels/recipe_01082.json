    "For the baked oatmeal: Preheat oven to 375 F and lightly grease an 8-in square baking pan. Combine first two ingredients in a bowl, then pour in an even layer into the bottom of the pan. In a mixing bowl, combine all remaining ingredients but the last 1/2 cup milk, and stir to combine. Spread this evenly over the pineapple or mango, then pour the remaining 1/2 cup milk evenly on top. Bake 35 minutes, then let sit 5 minutes before cutting into slices, using a knife or a very-large cookie cutter. Makes 4-6 servings. For a piña colada oatmeal variation: add 1/2 cup shredded coconut to the mixing bowl. Use canned coconut milk as your milk of choice."
