    "Directions",
    "Melt all of the chocolate using a double boiler. If you are adding coconut oil, now is the time to do it. Just stir it in with the chocolate as it melts.",
    "Line a muffin pan with cupcake liners (regular or mini both work). Spoon a little of the melted chocolate into the liners. Fill them about ¼ of the way full.",
    "Put the entire muffin pan in the freezer for about 5 minutes to let the chocolate set a bit.",
    "Take the pan out of the freezer and scoop some almond butter on top of the chocolate. The amount of almond butter you use is completely up to you, but I wouldn't fill it more than ¾ of the way.",
    "Spoon more melted chocolate over the almond butter until it’s covered completely.",
    "Put the muffin pan back in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. When you take it out, just pop the cups out of the muffin pan."
