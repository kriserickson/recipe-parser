    "Cook rice with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt according to package instructions. Set aside, covered, to steam.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the oil over medium in your largest skillet or griddle until glistening. Crack in the eggs and cook until golden-brown around the edges, about 2 minutes. Cover loosely using a lid or aluminum foil and cook until the whites are just set and the yolks are still runny but starting to set. (They’ll break and mingle with the rice in a beautiful way.) Season with salt and pepper.",
    "While the eggs cook, fluff the cooked rice with a fork, then stir in the kale, cilantro and parsley. Add the garlic and jalapeño a little at a time and taste, adding more salt, garlic or jalapeño to your liking.",
    "Spoon rice into shallow bowls and top with the fried eggs, radishes, cheese and lime wedges. Serve with your hot sauce of choice."
