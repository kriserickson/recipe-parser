    "For the green juice, process all ingredients through your juicer. Enjoy strained or unstrained.",
    "For a coconut water turmeric elixir: mix 1 oz of juiced turmeric root with 1 cup raw coconut water, and a pinch of freshly ground black pepper. The coconut water acts a “carrier” delivering more nutrients to the cells, and the piperine in the pepper helps the curcumin in the turmeric to absorb better."
