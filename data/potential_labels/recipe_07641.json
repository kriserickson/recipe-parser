    "Add all the ingredients into a large saucepan, bring to a boil and cook on medium-low heat for about 10-12 minutes. Stir from time to time.",
    "Take the pan off the heat and blend creamy with a hand blender for at least 2-3 minutes. The longer you blend, the creamier the hot chocolate gets. Pour into cups, serve with your favorite spoon.",
    "If you want to top your hot chocolate with some extra froth, save some hot chocolate, heat up some soy milk and foam it up with a frother. Add on top of the creamy hot chocolate, top off with a spoon of the hot chocolate and sprinkle some cacao nibs on top. Enjoy!:)",

    "If you’re not the biggest fan of hot chocolate but you like chocolate in general, make this recipe the same way and let the hot chocolate cool completely in the fridge for a few hours. The cooled hot chocolate can also be spooned and is almost like a chocolate cream, super tasty!"
