    "Prepare a large bowl of hot water to soften rice paper in.",
    "Working one at a time, submerge rice paper into hot water (be careful!) for about 5-10 seconds, or until it is just starting to soften. Don't soak it for too long or it'll tear to bits.",
    "Place a small bed of salad leaves in the middle of the softened rice paper, and then top with small amounts of every other ingredient. Although tempting, try not to over-fill the rolls as it will make it hard to roll up.",
    "Roll rice paper roll up, egg-roll style. (Bottom up, sides in, and roll to close).",
    "Serve with hoisin peanut sauce at the side. Rice paper rolls are best eaten fresh."
