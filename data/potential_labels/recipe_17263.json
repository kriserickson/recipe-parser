    "Preheat oven to 400 F and Place a piece of parchment on a large sheet pan (or use two pans if needed)",
    "Using a vegetable peeler, peel eggplant if you want – or just remove some of the skin in long stripes. Or if you prefer, leave the skin on. Cut into ½ inch thick bite-sized pieces. Slice the bell pepper into ½ inch wide strips. Cut the tomatoes into 3/4 inch wedges. Slice the zucchini the long way and then slice into ½ inch thick half moons. Slice the onion into ¼-½ inch thick half moons.",
    "Spread out the veggies on the sheet pan in a single layer (you may need two sheet pans). Add whole garlic and herbs.",
    "Drizzle with olive oil and toss, using enough oil to coat. Sprinkle with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Toss well.",
    "Roast in the hot oven for 20 minutes, mix, roast 20 more minutes, mix again. Turn heat down to 300 and roast 10-20 more minutes, or until tender and beginning to caramelize.",
    "Taste, adjust salt, and drizzle with a little splash of balsamic. Cool and refrigerate until ready to use."
