    "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until it begins to soften. Do not let it brown! Add the zucchini and garlic, and stir until nearly dry. Add the salt, water and bouillon cubes. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Adjust the heat to maintain a steady simmer and cook, uncovered, for about 10 minutes, until the vegetables are very tender.",
    "Transfer the contents of the pot to a blender and add the chives and mint. Process until smooth. Return to the pot, add the pepper, and reheat. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed. Serve at once, garnished with the optional chive blossoms, if using.",
    "If you would like to try the version in Speed Vegan, simply substitute 1/4 cup basil leaves, firmly packed, for the chives and mint."
