    "In a small saucepan, stir together rhubarb, water and sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until rhubarb is very soft and starting to fall apart, 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "Pour rhubarb mixture through a fine mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing on solids to release all their liquid. Discard solids and cool syrup. You will have about 1 cup.",
    "Fill four small old-fashioned glasses with ice. Add 1 oz vodka and 1/4 of the rhubarb syrup to each one. Top with a splash of bubbly water and garnish with a stick of raw rhubarb and a little side saucer of sugar, for dipping. Makes four cocktails."
