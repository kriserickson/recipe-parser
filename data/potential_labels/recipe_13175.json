    "Instructions",
    "Bring a medium pot with a pinch of salt, water and the corn to a boil. Once boiling, let cook for 2-3 more minutes or until corn is easily pierced with a fork. Strain and set aside.",
    "While the corn cooks, place the cod in a bowl with the olive oil, garlic and lime juice and combine. Let sit for 5 minutes. Then, remove the fish from the marinade and season the cod with Cajun seasoning.",
    "While fish marinates, place all of the ingredients for the dressing into a food processor and pulse until creamy. Taste and adjust, if needed. Set aside.",
    "Heat a grill pan or skillet to medium-high. Once heated, place in the cod and cook for about 5 minutes, turning halfway until fish is opaque and flakes easily.",
    "While fish cooks, scrape the corn off the cob with a knife into a small bowl and set aside. Also, toss the zucchini noodles in a large bowl with the avocado sauce until fully combined.",
    "Once fish is done cooking, assemble the fish taco bowls: divide the zucchini noodles into three bowls and place equal portions of black beans, corn and tomatoes. Top each with a piece of fish and garnish with jalapeno slices. Serve immediately."
