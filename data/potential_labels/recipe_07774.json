    "In a bowl, mix together the carom seeds, salt, oil and wheat flour. Gradually add the water and knead the dough until smooth. Divide into equal portions and roll out as thinly as possible. Spread butter over the surface, and sprinkle over about one tablespoon of dried mint leaves.",
    "For each paratha, make small pleats and fold in the dough like a fan. Now coil it into a circle and flatten out with a rolling pin like a roti.",
    "Heat oil in a flat pan and fry one paratha at a time until cooked through and light golden brown on each side. Transfer to a kitchen towel to drain out any excess oil. Serve hot with butter.",
