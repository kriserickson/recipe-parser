    "Preparing the soup: Heat oil in large saucepan. Add onion, garlic and chili, lower the heat and let stir for a couple of minutes or until softened. Stir occasionally. Stir in spinach, kale and nutmeg and gently cook for 1 minute. Then add water or broth and cook for 20 more minutes until the spinach and kale has completely wilted down. Season to taste. Serve as it is or blend it silky smooth, both ways are delicious.",
