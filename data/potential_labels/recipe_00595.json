    "Melt butter over medium heat in a large stockpot. Add smoked sausage and brown lightly. Stir often to avoid burning. Remove sausage to a bowl or plate with a slotted spoon. *Don’t drain the grease from the stockpot.",
    "Add potatoes, celery, onion and garlic to the pot and saute until onions are beginning to turn translucent. Stir frequently and reduce heat to avoid over-browning on the bottom of the pan. Remove vegetables to a bowl.",
    "Add chicken broth, sour cream, salt and pepper to the stockpot. Use a whisk to deglaze the pan over low heat. There’s a ton of flavor in those brown bits. ;) When the broth mixture begins to bubble, add sausage, vegetables, cream corn and frozen corn. Bring to a boil and simmer for 30-45 minutes or until potatoes and celery are cooked.",
    "Garnish with parsley before serving.",
    "Note: I have finished up the chowder in a slow cooker on low for a 3-4 hours, instead of cooking the veggies through on the cooktop.",
