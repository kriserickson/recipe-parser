    "Whisk dressing ingredients together. Taste, adjust seasonings, and set aside.",
    "Place chopped kale leaves in a large bowl, drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and a few pinches of salt. Using your hands, rub the leaves together massaging the kale until it becomes soft and darker in color. Toss with half of the dressing. Set aside.",
    "Slice your butternut squash lengthwise in half, scoop out the seeds, and slice lengthwise again and again so you have long wedges. Using a regular vegetable peeler, peel off long strips.",
    "Assemble the salad: toss the kale, butternut ribbons, apple slices, parsley, pine nuts, and chives with the remainder of the dressing. Let it sit at room temp for 10-15 minutes (for best flavor) and serve with shaved pecorino and a pinch of red chile flakes, if you like."
