    "Lightly spray a large plate with non-stick spray. Place the tortilla on top and give it a light spray as well. Sprinkle on your seasoning.",
    "Microwave on high for one minute. Carefully flip the tortilla (it will be hot) and microwave again for one minute. Carefully flip again (the plate gets SUPER HOT) and microwave in increments of 30 seconds until crispy. NOTE: Sometimes it takes 5-10 seconds after it comes out of the microwave for it to fully crisp because the steam is still evaporating. My first tortilla only took 2.5 minutes, my second tortilla took 3 minutes. Both felt just slightly soft/damp when taking them out of the microwave but got completely crispy after just sitting there a few seconds.",
    "Break the tortilla up and enjoy!"
