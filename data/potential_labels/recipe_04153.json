    "Halve the eggs and carefully remove the yolk. Set the whites aside, and add the yolks to a bowl, along with the mayonnaise, mustard, salt and pepper. Mash these ingredients together with a fork until smooth and creamy. Adjust seasoning to taste.",
    "Scoop a little mound of the seasoned yolks into the eggs with a spoon. Or add the yolks to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and fill the halved whites with a spritz of seasoned yolk.",
    "Serve the eggs well chilled. A good way to keep them from sliding all over a serving platters is to set them in a bed of salad greens or fresh herbs like parsley or chives."
