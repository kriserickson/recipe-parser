    "Stir all the waffle batter ingredients together in a large mixing bowl until well combined. Preheat a waffle iron.",
    "Pour batter into waffle iron and cook until golden brown. While it's still in the waffle iron, cut the waffle in half and carefully spread each side with Nutella. Add a layer of mini marshmallows to one of the two halves, and then fold the remaining half over on top of the marshmallows. Close the waffle iron enough to press both sides together and melt the marshmallows (about 3-4 minutes).",
    "Remove from waffle iron and top with syrup, toasted coconut, and more crushed graham crackers. Mmmmmm yes."
