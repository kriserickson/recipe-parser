    "In a large, deep pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper, celery and garlic and sauté 3 minutes longer. Add the beans, hock, chili powder, thyme and bay leaves and cover with water, about 8 cups. Bring to a boil, partially cover and cook for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 2 hours. The beans should be tender. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Remove the hock and mash the beans a bit with the back of a ladle.",
