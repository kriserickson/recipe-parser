    "In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Don’t overcook the pasta, especially if you’re using one that is gluten-free. Drain the pasta well and transfer to a large bowl. Set aside.",
    "While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat and sauté the onion, and shallot until soft. Add the garlic and cook a few more minutes until the onions are lightly brown. Remove from the heat.",
    "In a blender, combine half of the cooked onion mixture, water, pumpkin, cashews, nutritional yeast, bouillon, salt, sage and nutmeg. Blend until the mixture is super-smooth and velvety, and no traces of nuts remain.",
    "Add the pumpkin sauce to the reserved cooked onions in the skillet, giving it a good stir. Heat over medium heat, until sauce is hot. Toss with hot pasta, add salt and pepper to taste and serve."
