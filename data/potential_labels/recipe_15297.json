    "Prepare the honey mustard sauce by stirring together the mayonnaise, Dijon, honey, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 15 cranks of a pepper mill). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Use a paper towel to dry off the surface of the pork chops, then season each side with a pinch of salt and freshly cracked pepper. Heat one tablespoon of vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot add two pork chops at a time and cook until golden brown on each side (3-5 minutes). Place the browned pork chops in a casserole dish coated with non-stick spray.",
    "Smear the honey mustard sauce over the surface of the pork chops in the casserole dish. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the chops from the oven, then set the oven to broil. Move the oven rack so that the surface of the chops will be about 6 inches from the broiler. Broil the chops for 3-5 minutes or until the surface is golden brown and bubbly. Serve hot."
