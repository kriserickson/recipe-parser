    "Combine all ingredients in a large heavy bottomed pot. Stir and let the mixture rest at room temperature for an hour. The peaches will release their juices as the sugar starts to dissolve. Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce to medium high to maintain a boiling temperature for about 20-25 minutes. Stir frequently, as the mixture thickens.",
    "The mixture will initially foam constantly, then the foam will reduce as the jam is finishing it's cooking time. Test the jam by dropping a teaspoon's worth onto a plate. When it thickens and doesn't run, it is done. Remove from the heat and pour into sterile jars. Process in a hot water bath and then store in a cool dark place; or store in the refrigerator until ready to use. The jam will keep in the refrigerator for up to a month or alternatively, you can freeze it for up to 6 months. Enjoy!"
