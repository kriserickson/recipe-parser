    "Spread brownie batter in a greased 9” pie plate. Chill batter in fridge while the oven preheats to 350 degrees. Bake for 28-30 minutes. Let cool completely. I like to chill the brownies in an ice bath while prepping the peanut butter layer.",
    "Blend peanut butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla together. Spread over cooled brownies. Pop the pie into the freezer and make the topping.",
    "Make the ganache by heating coconut milk just to a boil. Pour hot milk over chocolate. Let mixture sit for a few minutes before stirring. Stir ganache, then spread over peanut butter layer.",
    "Store pie in the fridge. Slice while chilled for the cleanest edges. Yep, I’m all about eating clean. If you have leftovers, store slices frozen to enjoy as needed."
