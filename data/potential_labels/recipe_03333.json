    "1 Melt butter in a large, heavy bottomed soup pot on medium heat. Add the sliced leeks, cabbage, and kale, toss to coat with the butter. Lower the heat to low, cover and gently cook until the greens are wilted, about 12 to 15 minutes.",
    "2 Add the diced potatoes to the pot, along wit the chicken stock, bay leaves, and salt. Increase heat to bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until the potatoes are softened and falling apart, about 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "3 Remove from heat. Swirl in the white pepper, heavy cream, and sliced green onions. Taste and add more salt and pepper to taste."
