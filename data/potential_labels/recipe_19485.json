    "Tilapia, catfish, haddock and other lean types of fish may be frozen for up to 6 months. Oily fish, such as mackerel and grouper, shouldn’t be frozen for more than 3 months.",
    "Unless otherwise specified, Taste of Home recipes are tested with lightly salted butter. Unsalted, or sweet, butter is sometimes used to achieve a buttery flavor, such as in shortbread cookies or buttercream frosting. In these recipes, added salt would detract from the buttery taste desired.",
