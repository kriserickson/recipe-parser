    "Preheat stainless steel pan on medium. Season fish filet with salt and pepper. To check if your pan is hot enough, add a teaspoon of water. If it sizzles and steams, then it's not hot enough. Continue to preheat until a teaspoon of hot water remains in a small ball and floats over the pan like a \"mercury ball.\" At this point, it's ready. Add oil and filets skin side down. Do not touch the filet until they are cooked about 2/3rd through. Carefully flip and finish the cooking for another minute and remove from heat and set aside.",
    "Remove the pan from the heat. Turn down to medium low and add the ginger and saute until fragrant. Deglaze the pan with stock or wine. Stir vigariously with wooden spoon to scrap up any sticky bits of food on bottom of pan. Continue to heat until liquid has reduced by about 50%. Add the butter and miso and stir until completely dissolved and sauce has emulsified and thickened and remove from heat.",
    "Spoon pan sauce over the pan seared fish and serve with favorite vegetable side."
