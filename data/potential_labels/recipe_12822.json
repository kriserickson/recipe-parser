    "Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Remove steak from fridge and allow to come to room temperature. Strip the rosemary leaves from the sprig. Crush the garlic with the back of your knife. Core, seed, and remove the white veins from bell pepper, then thinly slice. Toss the bell pepper on a baking sheet with 1/2 table spoon and a pinch of salt and pepper. Wrap the garlic and rosemary in foil with 1/2 table spoon olive oil. Place foil bundle on the baking sheet with the peppers. Roast for 15 minutes, tossing peppers halfway through.",
    "Heat 1 tablespoon in a medium oven-proof pan over medium high-heat. Pat the steak dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Transfer pan to the oven and roast for 6-8 minutes, or until cooked to desired doneness. Set aside to rest. HINT: If you don't have an oven-proof pan, just transfer the stake to the baking sheet to finish!",
    "Cut the baguette into 1/2-inch slices on a diagonal. Place the bread on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and toast for 5-6 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, once the garlic is softened, mash with a fork to form a paste. Coarsely chop the rosemary leaves. To make the dressing, whisk together roasted garlic, rosemary, 1 table spoon white wine vinegar, and 2 table spoons olive oil in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Toss the greens in the dressing with the roasted peppers. Thinly slice the steak against the grain and arrange over a bed of the greens. Top with the crumbled goat cheese and serve with baguette toasts to the side."
