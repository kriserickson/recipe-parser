    "In a large pot, simmer the meatballs in the pasta sauce for about 10 minutes. Use low to medium heat.",
    "While the meatballs are simmering, prepare the zoodles. Rinse and dry the zucchinis then chop off the ends. You can either use a spiralizer or a julienne peeler to make the zoodles. Simply follow the manufacturer’s instruction on whichever gadget you are using. For a julienne peeler, place the side with the sharp teeth on the zucchini and drag it down the entire length of the vegetable. Remove the zoodles you just made and transfer to a plate. Repeat the process until you just about reach the seeded part in the middle.",
    "When done, add the zoodles to the simmering meatballs and stir. Don’t worry if the sauce seems dry because the zoodles will release some liquid as it cooks. Cook for about 3-5 minutes or until the zoodles are cooked but still retain some crunch and not mushy. Season to taste with a little salt and pepper, if needed. Serve with some parmesan on the side, if desired. Enjoy!"
