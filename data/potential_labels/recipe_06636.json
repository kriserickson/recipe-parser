    "Then pour in the can of consomme. Beef broth can also be used.",
    "Note: You can read all about the difference between beef broth and consomme in this post.",
    "But I’ll just go ahead and tell you the most important difference as it relates to this dish. Now, listen up, because this is vital:",
    "I had beef consomme in my pantry. I did not have beef broth in my pantry. So I used beef consomme. The end.",
    "Now, add in about 15 or so pepperoncinis, along with half the juice of a 16 ounce jar.",
    "Dump in 3 or 4 tablespoons of Italian seasoning. Depending on whether or not the seasoning contains salt, you’ll need to add a little of that, too.",
    "Stir around the liquid and seasonings a bit. And that’s it!",
    "Now cover the pot and stick it into a 275 degree oven for 5 to 6 hours. Don’t even worry about checking on it; just let the magic happen. You can also use a slow cooker if that’s your preference, or (as we’ll see in the next recipe) you can simmer it on the stove. Versatility galore!",
    "Next, let’s get the other one started. This is a little more basic, a little less risky (it doesn’t contain spicy peppers), and produces quite a bit more liquid than the first."
