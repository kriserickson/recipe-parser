    "Soak the dried mushrooms in 500ml boiling water for 20 mins, then drain the liquid into the stock. The mushrooms will have absorbed a lot of the liquid; you should have5l in total. Chop the soaked mushrooms and add to the chestnut mushrooms.",
    "Make the risotto: start by frying the bacon in half the butter, then add the onion. When they are soft, add the mushrooms and continue to cook for a few mins until soft. Stir through the rice and continue as in the basic recipe. When you add the final ladle of stock, stir through the chicken to reheat. Add the chopped parsley with the Parmesan and remaining butter, leave to rest for a few mins, then stir through and serve."
