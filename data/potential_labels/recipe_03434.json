    "Make the Garam Masala: Add the star anise, Guajillo chile, cinnamon stick, mustard seeds, anise, pink peppercorns, black peppercorns, cumin, coriander and cloves to a sauté pan over medium heat. Toast until the spices turn fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Using a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle, grind the spices into a powder. Mix the garam masala with the salt and sugar.",
    "Make the chicken and cabbage: Preheat the oven to 375degrees. Massage ¼ cup of the garam masala (reserve any remaining for another use) onto the chicken pieces. Arrange on a baking sheet and roast until well browned and crispy and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 175°, 30-40 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, add the bacon to a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until fat is rendered out and the bacon is crispy , about 5 minutes. Add the onion and cook until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add the cabbage, mustard seeds, cinnamon stick, cloves, sugar, white wine and red wine vinegar along with 1 cup of water to the pot. Lower the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, until tender, about 45 minutes. Serve the chicken with the cabbage."
