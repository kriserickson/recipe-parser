    "Once water is boiling, put in soba noodles and cook for 3-4 minutes until just undercooked. If you want to make this a one-pot meal, blanch broccoli in the same pot as soba noodles.",
    "Drain noodles (and vegetables if you put it in the same pot) and run under cold water so that the noodles don't get goopy.",
    "In the same pot, add a splash of water to reheat the noodles more easily (you are steaming them). Add noodles, broccoli, edamame and peanut sauce.",
    "Steam everything together for 1-2 minutes, mixing occasionally to distribute sauce evenly.",
    "Once everything is re-heated, serve and garnish with green onion and peanuts."
