    "Roll out pizza dough into a 14 inch circle on a pizza pan. In a small bowl, combine onion powder, sesame seeds, poppy seeds and salt. Spread olive oil evenly over the pizza dough and sprinkle the bagel topping mixture on top of the dough, focusing mostly on the crust region. Bake pizza in oven for 15-18 minutes, or until crust is nicely brown. Let pizza crust cool for about 15 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix creme fraiche, cream cheese, minced red onion and dill. Season with salt & pepper and spread evenly over pizza, making sure to leave room for the crust. Top cream cheese with cucumbers, sliced red onions and capers. Cut the pizza into slices and top each piece with a generous amount of smoked salmon. Top with dill sprigs and serve!"
