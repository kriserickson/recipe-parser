    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.",
    "Grate 1 Tbs. zest from the lemons and squeeze 3 Tbs. juice. In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the cream and lemon zest and heat until hot. Remove from the heat if the mixture begins to boil. In a small bowl, combine the shrimp, lemon juice and chives; set aside.",
    "Add the 2 Tbs. salt and the pasta to the boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until al dente, according to the package instructions.",
    "When the pasta is within about 3 minutes of being al dente, in a fry pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the shrimp to the pan and cook, stirring, until they are opaque throughout, about 2 minutes. Add the warm cream to the pan and season the sauce with salt and white pepper.",
    "Drain the pasta and add it to the fry pan. Toss the pasta to coat with the sauce and serve immediately. Serves 4."
