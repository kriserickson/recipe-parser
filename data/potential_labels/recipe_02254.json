    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Heat the oven to 350ºF.",
    "Beat the eggs with the mixer until fluffy, about 8 minutes.",
    "In another mixing bowl, stir together the sugar, butter, salt, vanilla, and syrups. Gently fold this into the eggs. Gently fold in the pecans. Pour the filling into the piecrust.",
    "Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until the filling is set and no longer wobbly in the center.",
    "Let cool completely before cutting.",
    "COOK'S NOTE",
    "This is Phil’s favorite, and the good news is he makes it himself! I make the crust while he is mixing together the pie filling, and in no time we have a fresh pie on the counter. Everyone declares it’s the best they’ve ever tasted."
