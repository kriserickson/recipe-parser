    "Preheat oven to 350°. Spread pine nuts on a small cookie sheet and bake about 5 minutes or until fragrant and lightly toasted. Be careful not to burn the nuts. Remove from hot pan and set aside.",
    "Bring 1 3/4 cups water to a boil, then add uncooked rice, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Return to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 5 minutes. Remove from heat, stir, cover pot and let stand for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.",
