    "Directions",
    "1. Poke spaghetti squash with a fork throughout the skin, then place the squash in the slow cooker on high for three hours with a cup of water.",
    "2.While squash is cooking, add bacon to a skillet, and fry up in olive oil, if using, until soft. (Bacon will do more cooking in the slow cooker later.)",
    "3. When spaghetti squash is finished, remove from slow cooker. Cut open with a knife and scoop out the spaghetti strands. Leave the water from cooking in the slow cooker.",
    "4. Place spaghetti strands back into slow cooker with bacon, peas, cream cheese and salt and pepper, and cook on high for another 45 minutes to an hour.",
    "5. 20 minutes into final cook time, add parmesan, and give mixture a good stir to make sure the cheese coats the ‘pasta’. Top with a bit of parmesan, and enjoy!",
