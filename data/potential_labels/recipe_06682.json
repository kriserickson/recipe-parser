    "Generously butter a large rimmed baking sheet. Place trout on baking sheet skin-side down. Season cavity of each trout generously with salt and pepper; top each with 2 to 4 sprigs of dill and 3 lemon slices. Fold over to enclose the trout and season the skin with salt and pepper; brush lightly with butter. Transfer to oven; cook 4 to 5 minutes. Rotate pan and continue cooking until skin is crispy and golden brown and flesh is just opaque throughout, 4 to 5 minutes more.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large bowl, toss watercress, radishes, feta, and walnuts with vinaigrette. Divide salad evenly between 4 plates. Transfer trout to plates and serve immediately with a dollop of creme fraiche."
