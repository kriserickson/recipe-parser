    "Set up your crock pot and pour in about a cup of salsa, spreading it around to make an even layer. In a medium bowl, combine the beans, corn, scallions, spices, and half of the shredded cheese. Put about a third of a cup of the mixture into a tortilla and roll it up tight. Place the tortilla seam side down into the salsa-coated crock pot.",
    "Repeat until you have about three or four squeezed into the crock pot in a single layer. Pour another cup of salsa over those enchiladas and top with 1/2 cup of cheese. Then repeat the enchilada-making process to create another layer in the crock pot. When you get to the last layer, top with salsa but not with cheese. Heat the crock pot on high for 2-4 hours.",
    "When the enchiladas are done cooking, serve with a sprinkling of cheese, a dollop of sour cream,Â and some chopped cilantro."
