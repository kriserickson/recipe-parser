    "Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. The size of your cookie sheet doesn't really matter. If you like your bark thinner you'll just spread the chocolate into a larger rectangle and if you want a thinner bark spread it into a smaller rectangle.",
    "Melt half of the chocolate (1 pound) according to the package directions. Spoon chocolate onto the parchment lined sheet and spread with an offset spatula to desired thickness. Chill in the freezer for at least 10 minutes.",
    "While the chocolate is hardening, mix together the peanut butter, powdered sugar, melted butter and vanilla (if adding) with a stand or hand mixer until well combined.",
    "Once chocolate has chilled, press peanut butter mixture gently on top of the hardened chocolate in an even layer. If can chill the peanut butter layer here for 10 minutes but I always skip this step.",
    "Melt the remaining half (1 pound) of chocolate according to package directions. Pour over peanut butter layer and spread into an even layer.",
    "Chill for at least 30 minutes and then using a sharp knife cut into squares. They will not cut in perfect squares but that's the beauty of this bark. Store in the fridge. Enjoy!"
