    "In a medium saucepan, combine all of the ingredients for the fudge and let melt completely over medium heat. Once melted, pour over the prepared cookie mixture.",

    "Place in oven and bake for 25 minutes. If the top is getting browned after 15 minutes, cover with foil. Let cool completely, so the insides don't run everywhere."
