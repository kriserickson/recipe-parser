    "Directions:",
    "1. Preheat oven or grill to 350 degrees F. For each serving, assemble an individual portion of ingredients in a large piece of foil (if you are using the oven, you can use parchment paper as an alternative) and seal. Place packets in the oven on a cookie sheet or over indirect heat on a well-oiled grill.",
    "2. Let the packets cook (essentially steam)Â for about 30 minutes, depending on your ingredients. You may need more time, or you may need a little less. Let the packets cool slightly before serving. While the packets certainly stand on their own, you can serve your packet meal with rice or fresh pasta, if you so desire."
