    "In a small saucepan over very low heat melt the butter, then skim off all the foam. Set aside for 1 to 2 minutes while the milk solids settle to the bottom. Carefully ladle the clear drawn butter into a bowl and discard milk solids on bottom of pan. Return clear butter to saucepan and stir in lemon juice, chives and a pinch or two of pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve.",
    "In a large pot over high heat, bring 6 quarts water and salt to a boil. Add thawed lobsters, return to a boil and cook 8 minutes. Remove with tongs and set on a cutting board to cool slightly. Turn lobsters belly side up and cut each lobster in half with a sharp knife or cleaver. Plate and serve with butter, lemon wedges and lobster cracking utensils."
