    "Meat Sauce:.",
    "Melt butter in a 3 1/2 Quart Dutch oven, sauté onion, ground chuck or lamb and garlic, stirring until brown, 10 minutes.",
    "Add herbs, spices and tomato sauce and stirring until it starts to boiling.",
    "Reduce heat and simmer, uncover, 1/2 hour.",
    "Halve unpaired eggplants lengthwise. Slice 1/2-inch thick.",
    "Place in bottom of broiler and sprinkle lightly with salt.",
    "Brush lightly with melted butter.",
    "Broil 4-inches from heat, 4 minutes per side, or until golden.",
    "Preheat oven to 350 Degrees.",
    "Make Cream Sauce.",
    "In medium saucepan, melt butter.",
    "Remove from heat and stir in flour, salt and pepper. Add milk gradually.",
    "Bring to boiling, stirring until thickened.",
    "Remove from heat.",
    "In small bowl beat eggs with wire whisk.",
    "Beat in some hot Cream Sauce mixture. Return mixture to saucepan and mix well. Set aside.",
    "To assemble casserole, in bottom of shallow, 2 quart baking dish (12x7x2 inches).",
    "Layer half of eggplants, overlapping slightly. Sprinkle with 2 Tbsp of each of grated parmesan and cheddar cheese. Stir bread crumbs into meat sauce. Spoon evenly over eggplant in casserole, then sprinkle with 2 Tbsp of each of parmesan and cheddar cheese.",
    "Layer rest of eggplant spices, overlapping, as before. Pour Cream Sauce over all. Sprinkle top of remaining cheese.",
    "Back 35 to 40 Minutes or until golden brown and top is set.",
    "If desired, brown top of little more under broiler, 1 minute.",
    "Cool slightly to serve. Cut in Squares.",
    "1",
    "First make the tomato sauce: peel and mince onions. Saute onions in 2 Tbsp oil and 2 Tbsp butter, over moderate heat, until they are soft and lightly colored (about 8 minutes). Add mush- rooms and saute. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, parsley, seasonings and sugar.",
    "Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered, for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, and the mixture is quite thick. Remove skillet from heat and let it cool completely.",
    "Start seasoning the eggplants: peel eggplants and slice vertically, 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit for 30 minutes.",
    "Now make the Bechamel Sauce. NOTE: The Bechamel-egg-ricotta mixture will overflow all but the largest (professional size) food processors. Use a mixer or blend by hand.Place the milk in a saucepan, and heat it just until tiny bubbles appear along the edges. Remove and set aside.",
    "Melt the butter in 3-quart saucepan over very low heat until foamy, being careful not to brown. Slowly add the 6 Tbsp flour, stirring constantly until smooth (3-4 minutes), and still being careful not to let it brown.",
    "Add the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk. When the mixture is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in seasonings.",
    "Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth and creamy. Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce. Stir in beaten eggs until thoroughly incorporated.",
    "Back to the eggplant: Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and pat dry. Dredge the eggplant in 1 1/2 cups flour, and saute each in olive oil until it is brown on both sides.",
    "Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the top of the tomato mixture. Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan that is at least 3 inches deep, and sprinkle the bottom with a few breadcrumbs.",
    "Place a layer of eggplant in the pan, following with a layer of tomato mixture. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and grated cheese. Repeat as many times as you have eggplant to last. Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 deg. F for one hour, or until a golden-brown crust has formed on top.",
    "Remove moussaka from oven and let it stand undisturbed 20-30 minutes; the delay allows the layers to fuse."
