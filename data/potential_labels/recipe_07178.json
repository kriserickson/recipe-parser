    "METHOD",
    "01.Place the onion, whole garlic cloves and rosemary in the slow cooker. Add the tomatoes, vinegar, wine and stock. Season well and stir well to mix together.",
    "02.Brown the lamb shanks all over in a large frying pan over a high heat, then add them to the slow cooker, pushing them into the tomatoey sauce so that they are almost completely covered.",
    "03.Cover with a lid and cook on the low setting for 8 hours. Skim off any fat that has risen to the surface, then serve with creamy mashed potato.",
    "Alternatively, this can be cooked in the oven. To oven-cook, brown the lamb all over in a large frying pan and set aside. Brown the onions and garlic in a little olive oil in a large casserole until soft. Add the rest of the ingredients, season and bring to a simmer. Add the lamb, put the lid on and cook at 160°C/fan140°C/gas 3 for 2 hours, until really tender.",
    "This is a hearty dish that deserves a rich, robust, but fine red wine. An upmarket claret (red Bordeaux) from the Médoc region, perhaps, or less expensive Vin de Pays d’Oc Cabernet Sauvignon."
