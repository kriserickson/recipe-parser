    "Recipe Directions",
    "1. Add both kinds of tomatoes and the salt to your food processor. Pulse briefly to incorporate. (Do not over-process, it's nice to leave this raw recipe a bit chunky.) 5 seconds should do it.",
    "2. Add the walnuts, and pulse very briefly again. Perhaps 8 seconds will do it! You don't want to overprocess, since you want to leave the walnuts in a small, round texture -- similar to ground round or ground beef. (Sorry!)",
    "3. To make your noodles, peel your zucchini (remove outer green peel).",
    "4. Use a clean vegetable peeler (or a spirooli spiralizer if you have one) to slice zucchini into “noodles.”",
    "5. Assemble and enjoy!"
