    "Prep and light your grill so that it is ready for cooking.",
    "Cut off the stems of your portobello mushroom caps and wipe off any dirt with a damp paper towel. Use 1½ tablespoons of the olive oil to brush the inside of the mushroom caps. Transfer mushroom caps to a grill and cover. Cook for ~7-10 minutes or until darkened and tender. Remove from the grill and transfer to a plate.",
    "To make the sauce, add the other 1½ tablespoons of olive oil to a pan and sauté the onion until translucent and soft, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste, sauce, oregano, and sage. Stir and bring to a simmer for 1-2 minutes, then turn off heat and set aside.",
    "Add 1-2 tablespoons of sauce to the inside of each mushroom cap. Evenly divide mozzarella cheese between all the mushroom caps and add your desired toppings.",
    "Place the prepped mushroom caps back on the grill, lining toward the outer edge of the grill. Grill for 2-3 minutes or until the cheese is melted."
