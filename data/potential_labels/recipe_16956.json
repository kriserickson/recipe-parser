    "PREPARATION",
    "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the nuts, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon olive oil, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
    "Once the water’s boiling, add the pasta and cook until al dente according to package directions. As the pasta cooks, make the sauce: In a sauté pan or skillet large enough to hold all the pasta, cook 3/4 cup olive oil, garlic and chile flakes over medium heat until the garlic turns blond, about 2 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to avoid burning.",
    "Add the squash and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally and pressing down on the mixture so it steams, until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove 1 cup of water from the pasta pot. Add 3/4 cup of the pasta water to the sauce, and let simmer until the water evaporates and a glossy sauce forms, about 2 minutes. Turn the heat to low.",
    "When the pasta is done, drain and immediately dump it into the sauce, tossing to coat. Adjust with salt, pepper and remaining pasta water. Serve with the nuts on top."
