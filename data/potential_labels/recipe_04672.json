    "Slice the sweet potato into bite-sized pieces, drizzle it with olive oil and place it on a baking tray in the oven for fifteen minutes.",
    "While the sweet potato cooks peel the beetroots and then chop them into pieces that match the size of the sweet potato, and then slice the sprouts in half.",
    "Once the sweet potatoes have cooked for fifteen minutes add the beets and sprouts to the baking tray, add a little more olive oil, salt, pepper and the chilli flakes. Place the tray back in the oven and let it bake for another thirty minutes – until the beets and sweet potatoes are nicely tender and the sprouts are getting crispy.",
    "Just before the veggies finish roasted make the kale. Tear the kale leaves off their stems into small pieces and add them to a frying pan with a little olive oil. Gently sauté the kale until it softens, then add the veggies to the pan once they’ve finished cooking.",
    "Stir the dressing together in a mug, pour it oven the salad, mix everything together and finally serve and enjoy!"
