  "title": "Droë Wors As mentioned previously, any good quality wors of the thin variety can be hung out to dry. This particular recipe however, dates right back to the era of the Great Trek in the early nineteenth century. This is how Droë Wors (dried sausage) tasted hundreds of years ago! Fundamentally the spice ingredients and the method of preparation remain the same as the boerewors recipe but the meat ingredients differ. For the Trekkers in those days venison, beef and mutton was abundantly available, but pigs were not suitable company for them and their nomadic lifestyle. Therefore, we use the same spices and method as for making boerewors , but the meat type and quantity is slightly different. TRADITIONAL RECIPE",
