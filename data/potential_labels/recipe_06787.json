    "Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cook, skin-side down, until the skin is browned and crisp (the meat doesn’t have to be cooked through), 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate; reserve the pot.",
    "Add the onion and bell pepper to the reserved pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and paprika. Cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the rice, broth, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Place the chicken, skin-side up, on top of the rice and vegetables. Cover, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook, covered, until the rice is tender and the broth has evaporated, 25 to 30 minutes.",
