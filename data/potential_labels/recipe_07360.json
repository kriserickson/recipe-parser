    "HOW TO BAKE BETTER SERIES: GRAIN FREE BAKING TIPS",
    "by CAROL LOVETT on AUGUST 17 in",
    "I have a slew of baking recipes to post on the blog but first I wanted to make sure you know some basic baking techniques. I did not invent these techniques. They have been used in baking for a long time and are used for a reason. A lot of paleo bloggers often write recipes that require you to take the dry ingredients and mix with the wet ingredients and bake. That’s more of a quick bread technique and there is nothing wrong with that I just don’t bake that way. When you bake my recipes please follow my directions and you will find the texture of your coconut flour baked goods more smooth verses grainy. I also give these instructions in my cookbook, Indulge.",
    "When I launched my dessert cookbook, Indulge, I had an inbox full of questions on how to bake better. One question I remember vividly came from a man who made the coconut flour coffee cake. He asked, “is it supposed to look like this?” He went on to describe to me how the finished coffee cake looked, and it was very flat and dense not like the picture in the cookbook. I asked him to walk me through how he baked the cake. He said, first he whipped the egg whites, with a fork, and they looked kind of bubbly, then he added more ingredients and baked it. I had made the mistake of assuming that people knew how to take egg whites and whip them to stiff peaks and also I assumed they would use a mixing machine and not do it by hand. Since then I have been wanting to put together a baking series that will help you become a better grain free baker.",
    "ALWAYS SIFT YOUR COCONUT FLOUR",
    "How to Sift Coconut Flour",
    "This is what it looks like when I sift my coconut flour. I take my small mesh strainer (like this one) and I scoop coconut flour into it and hold it over my container of coconut flour. I place my measuring cup underneath, for example if I want 1/2 cup of coconut flour, I place a 1/2 cup measuring cup underneath and I start gently shaking my strainer. This stops any hard lumps of coconut flour from getting into your baked goods.",
    "CREAM TOGETHER THE FAT + THE SUGAR",
    "How to Cream – On the left is coconut oil and raw honey. On the right is where it is mixed together.",
    "Many paleo bloggers ask you to melt the coconut oil when baking. I never ask you do that and then some people automatically do that to my recipes and I cringe. Instead I want you to cream the fat, in this case coconut oil with the sugar which I usually use raw honey. Creaming is not simply mixing it together. Creaming means to take your time to mix the ingredients together. It will look like ribbons in the bowl or another way I like to think of it, it looks like a bowl of icing. It takes a few minutes using a mix master (like this one) set on medium speed.",
    "How to Cream: on the left is coconut oil and raw honey mixed together. On the right is coconut oil and raw honey cream together. Do you see the difference in texture and appearance?",
    "The technique of creaming will incorporate air into the batter and since we do not have gluten to work with we must try to put as much air into the batter to create a light product. The resulting cake, muffins and cupcakes will have a finer velvety texture you didn’t even realize was possible with coconut flour. If you just used liquid fat you would miss out on all benefits."
