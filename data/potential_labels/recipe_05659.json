    "Place lamb in a large glass or ceramic baking dish. In a bowl, combine thyme, rosemary leaves, chives, garlic, olive oil, pepper, and salt and mash to bruise herbs and draw out flavourful oils. Rub herb mixture on lamb. Cover with beeswax wrap or cling film and marinate for at least 2 hours.",
    "Preheat barbecue to high. Place rosemary sprigs on grill and place lamb on rosemary. Grill for about 6 minutes. Turn lamb and grill for another 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and grill until internal temperature of meat reaches 130 deg F (55 deg C). Remove lamb from grill, place on a plate, and cover with foil. Let sit for 10 minutes, then slice off pieces about 1/2 in (1 cm) thick across grain of meat."
