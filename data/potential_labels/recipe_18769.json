    "Bring the broth to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. (The broth should be about 2 inches deep in the pan.) Add the star anise and cinnamon and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes to infuse the broth with the spices. When finished, use a slotted spoon to remove the spices.",
    "Crack the eggs into separate measuring cups and slip them into the simmering broth, one at a time. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the noodles and bok choy. Stir very gently to submerge the noodles and bok choy, but so as not to break the eggs. Cook for another 2 minutes, until the whites of the eggs are completely set but the yolks are still loose. (Cook for an additional minute if you like your yolks set.)",
    "Off the heat, gently stir in the soy sauce and the scallions. Taste and add more soy sauce if needed. Divide the soup between 2 bowls and eat immediately."
