    "To roast your lime wedges, heat up a cast iron grill pan. As the cast iron heats up, place the lime halves cut side down onto the grill pan. Don’t touch them for about 3 to 4 minutes.

    "To make your burritos, add some cauliflower rice, corn, vegan cheese, avocado, pico de gallo, vegan beef, adobo cream sauce, peppers and onions. Roll it up tightly and if using, roll up the burrito in some foil. Turn the heat back up to medium on the cast iron and place the burrito, seam side down onto the grill pan. Use a weight to press the burrito down gently for about 2 to 3 minutes. Grill the other side for 2 to 3 minutes. Slice in half before serving."
