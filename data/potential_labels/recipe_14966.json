    "In a medium bowl, mix the vanilla extract, oil, vinegar, and cold water.",
    "Slowly whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, being careful not to overmix. The mixture will be quite wet, but this is okay.",
    "Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. For cupcakes, the baking time is 24 to 26 minutes.",
    "Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool."
