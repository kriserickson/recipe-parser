    "To make the cheese bubbly and golden, switch your oven to broil on high for just a minute or so [keep an eye on it to prevent burning]",
    "Dig in right away and store leftovers for up to 4 days in a covered bowl. May be reheated in the oven or microwave. Enjoy!"

    "notes notes notes: I beelined for Target's Archer Farms Salsa Verde and Cabot Pepper Jack for this recipe, they're my go to for dips and taco nights! No cast iron skillet? No problem! You can make the dip in your favorite pot or pan and then transfer the mixture to a baking dish for the final step, basically grab any oven-safe dish that doubles as a serving dish and you're good to go!"
