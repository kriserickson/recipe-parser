    "Place the beans in a pot with the bay leaf and cover with water by 2 to 3 inches. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, add salt to taste and simmer gently until peas are tender but not mushy. Drain through a colander set over a bowl. Transfer the peas to a salad bowl.",
    "Meanwhile, heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat, and add 1 tablespoon of the oil. When it is hot, add the red pepper and cook, stirring often, until just crisp-tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cumin seeds, and stir together for another minute or two until the garlic is fragrant. Remove from the heat and toss with the peas. Toss with the vinegar, remaining olive oil, 1/4 cup of the bean broth, and salt and pepper to taste. Cool to room temperature.",
    "If using the red onion, place it in a bowl, cover with cold water, and soak for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse. Add to the salad along with the dill and parsley. Toss well. Sprinkle the feta over the top, and serve.",
