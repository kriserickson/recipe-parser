    "In a large pot, saute the onion and the garlic in the oil over medium heat until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and stir.",
    "Add the jalapeños, celery, and bell pepper and saute for another 5-7 minutes or so, until softened.",
    "Now add the can of diced tomatoes (with the juice), broth, and tomato paste. Stir to combine. Increase heat to medium-high.",
    "Add the drained and rinsed beans, along with the chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, cayenne, and hot sauce. Simmer the mixture until thickened, about 10-15 minutes and adjust seasonings to taste if necessary.",
    "Serve with Homemade vegan sour cream, chopped green onion, and cilantro leaves, if desired.",
    "Place cashews in a bowl and cover with water. Soak for a minimum of 2 hours, preferably overnight or for 8 hours if you have the time.",
    "Drain and rinse the cashews and place in the blender.",
    "Add water, lemon, vinegar, and salt. Blend on high until smooth. You might have to stop to scrape down the blender now and then or add a touch more water to get it going.",
    "Once it's super smooth, it's ready! Transfer into a small container. The cream will thicken up as it sits."
