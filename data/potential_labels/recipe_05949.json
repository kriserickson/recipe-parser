    "Grate the zucchini with a box grater or the grating attachment on a food processor. Pack about 1/2 cup into a quart jar. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Repeat the 1/2 cup grated zucchini and sea salt until you reach 1-1/2 inches from the top of the jar.",
    "Place a lid on the jar and allow to ferment for 2 to 5 days, depending on the temperature. Be sure to burp your jar every day by simply unscrewing the lid slightly and allowing the gas to escape."
