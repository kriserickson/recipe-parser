    "Preheat your oven to 350°F (176°C) and lightly spray an individual sized (~16oz./500 ml) ramekin with cooking spray or grease it with cooking oil. Set aside.",
    "In a medium-sized bowl, combine the oats, oat bran, flour, baking powder, and salt.",
    "In a smaller bowl, roughly mash the banana (some chunks are okay) before adding in the almond milk, maple syrup, and vanilla, mixing until well combined.",
    "Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until fully incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips.",
    "Transfer the dough to your greased ramekin and bake for 20 minutes, until the centre has set and the bake has reached your desired consistency.",
    "Meanwhile, make the sauce by mashing the other half of the banana in the same small bowl you used before before and adding a spoonful of nut butter. Mix until smooth, adding a splash of almond milk to reach your desired consistency. Pour over the bake once it comes out of the oven and sprinkle with additional chocolate chips, if desired."
