    "Place coconut and almond milk, xanthan gum, cocoa powder, vanilla and sugar in a blender and blend until well combined. Transfer to a mixing bowl, cover and refridgerate until chilled through - at least a couple hours.",
    "Once chilled, pour into pre-chilled ice cream maker and use according to directions. (Alternatively, pour into a freezer-safe container, cover and freezer, taking out to stir every couple hours to aerate.)",
    "Once the ice cream is at soft-serve consistency, add in brownie chunks. YOu can either do this at the end of the ice cream maker's churning process, or once you pour it into a container. Smooth the top with a spoon, cover and freeze until firm. Or, eat immediately though it will be quite soft."
