    "Directions:",
    "1. In a medium sized bowl, combine all dry ingredients and mix well. Add wet ingredients to bowl and, again, mix well.",
    "2. Add contents to a large pan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until it forms a ball.",
    "3. The dough is ready when the mixture pulls away from the pan and when the wet parts begin to look dry.",
    "4. Turn the dough onto your countertop and knead it until smooth. It will be quite warm to the touch, so be careful!",
    "5. Add food coloring, glitter, extracts, etc. AFTER the dough has cooled. The color and scents won't \"take\" as well when the dough is hot/very warm."
