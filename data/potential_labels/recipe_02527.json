    "In a small bowl whisk together peanut butter, soy sauce (or coconut aminos) honey, garlic and Sriracha. Add water, one tablespoon at a time, until reaching the desired thickness (I like mine to be pretty thin). Set aside.",
    "In a large frying pan (or using a wok if you own one) heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add beef strips and saute 8 to 10 minutes, making sure the beef is evenly cooked.",
    "When the beef has browned stir in ½ of the peanut sauce and cook for a couple minutes. If it looks too dry add some water, one tablespoon at a time.",
    "Serve warm with remaining sauce on top and sprinkled with scallion."
