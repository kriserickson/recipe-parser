    "1 Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Thinly slice the onion, then cut the courgettes into 5cm long, 2mm thick strips. In a large frying pan, warm the olive oil over a medium-low heat, then cook the onion and courgettes gently with a pinch of salt, turning them regularly with a wooden spoon until they are very soft and tender â€“ which will take about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.",
    "2 Add salt to a large pan of boiling water, stir, then add the linguine, fanning it out, and using a wooden spoon to push it down. Cook until al dente (check the cooking time of the packet and start tasting at least 2 minutes before).",
    "3 While the pasta is cooking, in a largish bowl whisk together the eggs, extra yolks, cheese, a pinch of salt and lots of pepper. During the last minutes of pasta cooking time, put the courgette pan back on the heat to thoroughly warm the fat and vegetables.",
    "4 Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the frying pan, stirring so it tangles with the vegetables. Turn off the heat, and, working quickly, add the egg mixture and a splash of pasta cooking water, then stir and swirl the pan vigorously until each strand is coated with creamy sauce and the consistency is slithery. Add a little more pasta cooking water if it seems too stiff and stir again. Rip the basil into the pan, stir again and serve."
