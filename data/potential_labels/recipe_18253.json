    "Drain chickpeas, reserving liquid from can. Combine chickpeas, water or stock, lemon juice, tahini, garlic, and salt in blender or food processor. Add 1/4 cup of reserved liquid from chickpeas. Blend for 3–5 minutes on low speed until thoroughly mixed and smooth. Place in serving bowl, and create a shallow well in the center of the hummus. Add olive oil in the well. Garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately with warm or toasted pita bread. If preferred, cover and refrigerate until required, and add the final oil and parsley garnish just before serving."
