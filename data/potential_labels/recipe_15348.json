    "Reserve the zest and juice of 1 Meyer lemon.",
    "In a medium-sized bowl, whisk 1/4 teaspoon sea salt into 3 tablespoons Meyer lemon juice, and then slowly whisk in the olive oil. Toss cherries into vinaigrette and set aside. Reserve any leftover Meyer lemon juice.",
    "Fry the bacon in a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. When edges have crisped, remove to a paper towel-lined plate to cool. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon grease.",
    "Meanwhile, using all necessary precaution, shave the brussels sprouts lengthwise using the thinnest setting on your mandoline.",
    "In a large bowl, toss shaved brussels sprouts with the warm bacon grease. Next, add the kale leaves, and toss everything with the vinaigrette and tart cherries. Top salad with 1 tablespoon reserved Meyer lemon zest, grated fresh horseradish, black pepper, and sea salt to taste. Crumble the prepared bacon over the top. Flavor will continue to develop for a day or so, covered in the fridge. Before serving, you'll likely want to add a pinch more sea salt and a generous splash reserved Meyer lemon juice."
