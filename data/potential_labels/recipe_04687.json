    "Cook pasta in salted water according to directions listed on package (keep in mind it will only take about 4 minutes so I recommend adding the pasta to water when you begin cooking the shrimp), reserve 1/2 cup pasta water before draining.",
    "In a large skillet, heat olive and butter over medium-high heat. Add shrimp (you can remove tails first if desired), season with salt and pepper and saute 2 minutes, then add garlic and saute until shrimp has cooked through, about 2 minutes longer.",
    "Toss drained pasta in with shrimp along with 1/3 cup reserved pasta water, lemon zest and lemon juice. Add more water 1 Tbsp at a time as needed. Toss in 2 Tbsp of each parsley and basil, then sprinkle top with parmesan cheese and remaining 1 Tbsp of each parsley and basil. Serve warm.",
