    "Add sugar and 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium-sized pot. Stir and reduce heat. Stir until the sugar has completely dissolved. Remove from heat and allow to cool.",
    "Using a juicer, juice 10 lemons. Makes about 1 1/4 cups of lemon juice. Using the juicer, \"juice\" the strawberries into the lemon juice. If needed, strain the lemon & strawberry juice into a large drink container. Add sugar water mixture (from above), 4 cups of cold water and ice. Mix with a large spatula or chopstick.",
    "Cut up 4 to 5 of the lemon rinds and add along with the sliced strawberries for garnishing. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve with ice and pink straws.",
    "Tip: If you let the lemons and strawberries sit in the lemonade overnight (refrigerated), you'll get a more pink of a lemonade."
