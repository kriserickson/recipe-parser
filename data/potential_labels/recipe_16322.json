    "Mix the first 8 ingredients together and form them into burgers (they will be pretty moist, but there is nothing worse than dry chicken). If the mix is too wet, add some breadcrumbs. Gently cook in a skillet for about 5 minutes on each side.",
    "While the burgers cook, make your aioli. Add the egg yolks and half the lemon juice and cider vinegar into a blender or bowl. Add a few drops of oil and blend or whisk until you create an emulsion. Add the garlic, remaining lemon, and vinegar and start to drizzle in the oil very slowly.",
    "Once you have a nice mayo like consistency, add the mustard, cayenne, and salt.",
    "Add cheese to your burgers and cover for a couple of minutes to melt the cheese. At the same time, toast the buns in the oven.",
    "Slather your aioli onto the buns, add lettuce, and then add your burger. Enjoy!"
