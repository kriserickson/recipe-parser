    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "1Pat the chicken breasts with paper towels to dry and place in a large zipper-lock plastic bag.",
    "2In a food processor, pulse the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, and black pepper until blended. With the motor running, drop the rosemary and garlic through the feed tube and continue to process until smooth. Add this marinade to the zipper-lock bag, seal, and shake to make sure the chicken is well coated. Place in a baking dish and refrigerate for 4 hours or up to overnight, turning the bag a few times.",
    "3Preheat the grill to medium heat.",
    "4Remove the chicken from the bag and arrange it on a well-oiled grill. Cook until a nice crust forms on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Let the chicken rest on a serving platter for 10 minutes before serving"
