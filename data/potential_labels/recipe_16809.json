    "Scoop the flesh of a ripe avocado into a bowl. Add the almond butter and mash together with a fork until smooth. Then add almond milk (or coconut milk), cacao powder, vanilla, stevia (to taste), protein powder (1/2 - 3/4 of a scoop), and sea salt to the bowl; mix together vigorously until all is mixed and smooth. (You could also use a food processor if you'd prefer.)",
    "If everything went right, the consistency will be similar to pudding... except normal pudding makes you FAT with loads of sugar! This healthy pudding recipe will actually HELP you to burn fat, control cravings, and satisfy your body's need for micro-nutrients, protein, healthy fats, and fiber.",
    "If the pudding ends up too thick, simply add a bit more almond milk or coconut milk for more moisture until the consistency seems right.",
    "If you want to get a little wild and add some more nutrient-rich additions, feel free to add some chopped pecans, chia seeds, rice bran, or walnuts at the end. And it tastes great to top this dish with some sliced strawberries!"
