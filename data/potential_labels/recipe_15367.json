    "Cook pasta according to package instructions. Prior to draining the pasta, reserve 1 cup of pasta water for thinning out the sauce.",
    "While the pasta is cooking, mix the sauce: Add hummus, artichoke hearts, spinach, garlic, Italian Seasoning, salt, and pepper to a large bowl and mix to combine well. Add some (you wonâ€™t need it all) pasta water to create a thick and creamy mixture.",
    "Once the pasta is done cooking, drain and add the noodles to the bowl with the sauce. Toss to coat, adding additional pasta water to thin if necessary. Serve immediately."
