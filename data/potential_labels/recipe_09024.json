    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and line round pizza baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Rinse cauliflower, remove the outer leaves and separate into florets with a paring knife. Place cauliflower florets in a food processor and process until \"rice\" texture. Some coarse chunks are fine.",
    "Place on a prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 mins.",
    "Remove cooked cauliflower from the oven and transfer to a bowl lined with a double/triple layered cheesecloth.",
    "Then squeeze the liquid out of the ball, cauliflower inside the cheesecloth, as hard as you can. Be patient and do this a few times until barely any liquid comes out. Muscle work.:)",
    "Increase oven T to 450 degrees F. Transfer cauliflower to a mixing bowl along with egg, cheese, herb seasoning, salt, black pepper and mix to combine. Transfer cauliflower mixture onto the same baking sheet you used to roast the florets (I used the same parchment paper but you can swap it for a new one if it gets too soggy), and flatten with your hands until thin pizza crust forms.",
    "Bake for 15 - 20 minutes and remove from the oven.",
    "Top with your favourite toppings and bake again until cheese on top turns golden brown. Slice and enjoy."
