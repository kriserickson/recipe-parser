    "In a large pot, heat olive oil (or butter) over medium-heat. Add onions, carrots, celery and garlic, and saute for 8-10 minutes or until onions are translucent.",
    "Add in the chicken stock, bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 30-45 minutes (or until veggies are completely soft). Add in chicken, then season to taste with salt and (lots of!) freshly-ground black pepper.",
    "Meanwhile, fill a medium-sized pot with water and add at least 1 Tbsp. salt, then bring to a boil. Add noodles (fresh or dried) and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain, then add the noodles to the soup pot. Remove bay leaves, then serve.",
    "(Optional: If you like a less-brothy soup, feel free to cook the noodles in with the soup broth. I get annoyed when they soak up all of that delicious broth, but others may like a chunkier soup.)"
