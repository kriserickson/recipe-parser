    "Heat a large casserole. Use a bit coconut oil or just vegetable broth for frying the onions and garlic. Do this for at least 3 minutes, before you add coconut milk and lentils, yellow curry paste. Then cook this for 20 minutes – please not longer. We don’t want the ingredients mushy or overcooked. Just 5 minutes from the end, add chickpeas.",
