    "Preheat your oven to 350F and line a baking sheet with a small piece of parchment paper. In a small bowl, combine the first 6 ingredients and mix well, until a uniform cookie dough is formed. Fold in the dark chocolate chips, then divide the batter into two balls and press them onto the parchment-lined baking sheet.",
    "Use your fingers to gently flatten the cookies, then bake for 8-9 minutes at 350F. The finished cookie should be dry and firm on the outside, and soft on the inside. Allow to cool briefly before serving.",
