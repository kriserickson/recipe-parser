    "Soak the shiitake mushrooms in hot water for 20 minutes, until they soften. Drain the mushrooms and squeeze them dry. Discard the stems and finely chop the mushroom caps.",
    "Quarter the eggplants length-wise, then cut 1/2-inch thick slices from each quarter.",
    "Heat the 1/3 cup oil in a wok over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Add the eggplants and stir-fry for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring often, until the outsides turn golden brown. Remove the eggplant with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on paper towels.",
    "Reduce the heat to medium and add the bacon. Cook the bacon for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and shittakes and stir-fry for another minute. Add the chili bean sauce and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return the eggplant to the wok. Pour in the chicken stock, soy sauce and sesame oil. Allow everything to simmer for a few minutes while the flavors penetrate the eggplants. Add salt if needed.",
    "Add the chopped scallions to the eggplant mix and cook for another minute. Remove from the wok and serve."
