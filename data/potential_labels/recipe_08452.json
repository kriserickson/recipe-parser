    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8x8 pan with coconut oil.",
    "In a medium sized bowl, whisk your eggs.",
    "Mash your banana on a plate and then add it to the bowl with the eggs, along with the honey and vanilla.",
    "Add the coconut flour, unsweetened shredded coconut, lemon peel and lemon juice and combine well so there are no clumps.",
    "Spoon batter into the greased pan and spread it out into an even layer.",
    "Bake your bars in the pre-heated oven for 20-25 minutes. When you start to see little bits of golden brown on top, check to see if they are firm, and if so, they're ready.",
    "To freeze, can score the bars while they're warm, and once they have cooled, lift each square out of the pan and place them into a freezer container or freezer bag.",
    "These defrost super quick in the microwave - all it takes is about 30 seconds. If you'd rather skip the microwave, just pull out what you need from the freezer the night before and leave them on the counter so they'll defrost overnight."
