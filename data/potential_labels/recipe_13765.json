    "Squeeze one of the oranges into your blender to provide enough juice to help it blend. Then add the rest of the orange pulp and the second orange, both carrots and the ginger to your blender, (see my blender recommendations). Add a splash or two of water to help it blend and thin out the consistency. You’ll need to add more water if you include the orange pith like I do and less water if you don’t. We like to leave the pith on as it’s loaded with fiber.",
    "Once you have all your ingredients in the blender, you know what to do – blend on high until smooth!"
