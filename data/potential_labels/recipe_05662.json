    "In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, pepper, salt, onion powder, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce. Form into thick patties.",
    "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the patties and onion in the oil until patties are nicely browned. Remove the beef patties to a plate, and keep warm.",
    "Sprinkle flour over the onions and drippings in the skillet. Stir in flour with a fork, scraping bits of beef off of the bottom as you stir. Gradually mix in the beef broth. Season with seasoned salt. Simmer and stir over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, until the gravy thickens. Turn heat to low, return patties to the gravy, cover, and simmer for another 15 minutes. Serve with a big bowl of mashed potatoes. (Recipe from Hillbilly Cast Iron Cooking.)"
