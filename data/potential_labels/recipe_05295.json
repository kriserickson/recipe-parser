    "Stir together the heavy cream, agave, cinnamon, cumin and salt in a large bowl.",
    "Place the chopped chocolate in the bowl of a double boiler. Set the bowl over a pot of gently simmering water and stir until the chocolate is fully melted, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pot and set on a dish towel to dry the bottom of the bowl.",
    "Using a hand-held mixer, whip the spiced cream just until it forms soft peaks, 2 to 3 minutes; be careful not to over-whip. Now, using a rubber spatula, quickly and gently fold the melted chocolate into the whipped cream. Serve immediately, or divide the mousse among serving bowls and refrigerate until ready to serve.",
