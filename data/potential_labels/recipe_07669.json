    "Preheat the oven to 425.",
    "Measure out 3 cups of cooked cauliflower rice. You can cook it by throwing it in the microwave for 2 minutes, OR saute it in a saucepan with a little olive oil (and any spices you like)",
    "Then using a paper towel, press out all the moisture you can from the rice. The more moisture you squeeze out, the better they will turn out.",
    "Add the egg, egg white, cheese, salt, and pepper. Combine using your hands.",
    "Form into 3/4 inch cauliflower tots (I got 32) and place on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Give the tots a spray of cooking spray on top.",
    "Cook for ten minutes and then flip over and cook for an additional 7-10 minutes until crispy.",
    "Tip: If they arenâ€™t holding their shape well, consider popping them in the freezer for about 10 minutes. Also, these freeze well so consider a double batch. They will need an extra 10-15 of cooking time if they are frozen."
