    "Add the yeast, sugar and 1 cup lukewarm water to a bowl and rest for a few minutes until the yeast starts to bloom. Add the honey, salt, oil and egg and mix to incorporate. Stir in 3 cups of lukewarm water.",
    "Add half of the flour and mix with a spoon until creamy. Add almost all of the rest of the flour (leaving over 1/2 cup or so) and knead with your hands until your dough is smooth and elastic, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is no longer sticky.",
    "When you are done kneading, grease the dough with oil and cover it with a towel. Put it in a warm place (I like to put my oven on 200 degrees and put it on top of the oven). Leave the dough to rise for 1 1/2-2 hours. Pound it down, take challa for hafrashas challah, and braid. When you are done shaping the loaves, leave them to rise for 30 minutes. Brush with egg and topping of your choice. Bake at 350 until golden brown, about 35 minutes. (check the bottoms of the challahs, they should be browned and hollow when you tap on them).",
    "NOTE: these come in envelopes of 3, use 1 3-pack plus a fourth packet from another 3-pack.",
    "ALLERGY NOTE: I have prepared this recipe without any eggs, and it works great!",
    "Sweet Crumb Topping:",
    "1 cup flour",
    "1 cup sugar",
    "1/3 – 1/2 cup canola oil",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract",
    "pinch sea salt",
    "Mix with a spoon until crumbly and sprinkle over challah.",
    "Honey or Maple Syrup Glaze:",
    "You can mix some honey or syrup in with the egg wash and brush over challah. For more of a sticky glaze, eggwash the challah as usual and bake. As soon as the challah comes out of oven, brush liberally with honey or maple syrup (you can warm it on the stovetop or microwave it to make it easier to spread). You’ll have a sweet and sticky glaze."
