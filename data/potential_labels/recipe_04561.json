    "For the dressing: Combine 1/3 cup of the olive oi with the balsamic vinegar, water, dates, shallots, and Dijon mustardl in a blender and process until very smooth. Season to taste and set aside until ready to use.",
    "TIP",
    "The dressing can be made up to 2 days in advance — refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to use.",
    "For the salad: Heat the oven to 400°F and arrange a rack in the middle. Meanwhile, divide the carrots, parsnips, and turnips between two rimmed baking sheets. Toss the vegetables in each pan with 1 tablespoon of the oil and half of the thyme. Arrange the onion wedges on the baking sheets, keeping them intact. Brush the onion wedges all over with the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil then season all the vegetables with salt and pepper.",
    "Roast the vegetables until they’re knife tender and golden brown, about 45 minutes. Remove vegetables from the oven and let them cool slightly. To serve, divide greens among serving plates, top with roasted vegetables and cheese, drizzle each salad with dressing and pass more on the side."
