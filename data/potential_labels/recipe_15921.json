    "Rinse your mushrooms with cool water in a colander to remove any dirt and debris. Cut them in half or in quarters to make them all about equal size and set them aside. Peel and mince the two cloves of garlic and set them aside. Zest and juice the lemon and set it aside.",
    "In a large skillet, cook the mushrooms in half of the olive oil (2 Tbsp) until they are soft and have released most of their water (about 5 minutes). They will be smaller and a deep taupe color when they are done. There will still be juices in the pan, this is okay. See photos below",
    "Turn off the burner and add the lemon juice, zest, minced garlic, thyme leaves, bay leaves, 2 Tbsp olive oil, salt and pepper. To easily remove the thyme leaves from the sprigs, simply pinch the top of the sprig and pull backwards (from top to bottom) and all of the little leaves will pop right off.",
    "Stir the mixture well and allow to come to room temperature in a bowl. This will allow the flavors to mix and the mushrooms to marinate. Enjoy!"
