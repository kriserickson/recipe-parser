    "In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the meat in the oil. Season with salt and pepper. Place in the slow cooker.",
    "In the same skillet over medium heat, brown the onions and garlic. Add oil if necessary. Dust with flour and cook for 1 more minute. Add the wine and bring to a boil while stirring. Transfer the mixture to the slow cooker and add the broth, tomatoes and thyme. Cover and cook until the meat is easily cut with a fork, about 6 hours with the cooker set to high or 8 hours with the cooker set to low. Remove the thyme. Adjust the seasoning.\nNote\nYou can also cook this dish in an oven preheated to 150°C (275°F). Cook for 4 to 5 hours."
