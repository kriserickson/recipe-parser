    "PREPARATION",
    "Heat oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Make the toasted oat and nut topping: Mix the oats, almonds, pumpkin seeds and hemp seeds together in a small bowl with salt and olive oil. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes, or just until fragrant and lightly toasted.",
    "Make the oatmeal: In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil, then add the oats and a pinch of salt. Reduce to a low simmer, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. Stir occasionally. Turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let steam for an additional 10 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the greens: Heat about 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the garlic and crushed red pepper. (The garlic should just sizzle but not brown.) Then add the greens, salt to taste, and briefly wilt for around one minute (but no longer than two); turn with tongs to evenly cook.",
    "Place the oatmeal in the bowl, surround with greens and pan juices, and garnish with about 1 tablespoon toasted oat and nut topping. Finish with a dollop of yogurt and freshly ground pepper. Sprinkle with a little salt and a drizzle of olive oil if desired.",
    "Tip",
    "Store extra topping in an airtight container at room temperature. Keeps for about two weeks.",
