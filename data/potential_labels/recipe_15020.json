    "Add the stock and cook, partially covered, until the squash is very tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. Using an immersion blender or a standing blender, puree the soup until smooth. Stir in the basil, the 2 Tbs. chives, the milk and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Gently reheat the soup over medium-low heat.",
    "Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and garnish with chives. Serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6."
