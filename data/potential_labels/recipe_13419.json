    "Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. In a medium skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in peas and salt and cook 1 more minute.",
    "Spread chips over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish and spoon pea mixture over the top. Sprinkle with cheese and bake just until cheese melts and the nachos are very hot, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro and squeeze lime over the top of the nachos. Squirt Sriracha sauce over the top (careful, it's very spicy!) and serve warm."
