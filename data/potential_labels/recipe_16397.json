    "In a wok, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over dried red pepper and Sichuan peppercorn over slow fire until aromatic and slightly dark red. Add garlic to fry for 5-10 second until aromatic.",
    "Turn up the fire and place shredded potatoes in immediately , season with salt, sugar, sesame oil and light soy sauce. Then add fresh peppers and mix well."
