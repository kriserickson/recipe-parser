    "Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chops with salt and pepper and cook, in batches, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest chop registers 145° F, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Reserve the skillet. Add the broth and mustard to the skillet, whisking to scrape up any browned bits. Cook until thickened, 2 to 4 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in another large skillet over medium heat. Cook the shallots, tossing occasionally, until browned and softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the radishes and cook until just beginning to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the sugar snap peas and cook just until crisp-tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the peas, season with ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper, and toss to combine.",
    "Serve the pork chops over the vegetables, with the gravy drizzled on top and sprinkled with the chives."
