    "In a small mixing bowl, using a mixer on medium speed, beat together cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract, until well combined, about 1 minute.",
    "In a medium sized mixing bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder and salt; whisk until combined.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, until combined. Whisk in melted butter-sugar mixture until well combined. Stir in flour mixture until just combined, followed by Oreo cookies.",
    "Spread half of brownie batter into baking dish, followed by cream cheese layer; dot the top with remaining brownie batter, and spread evenly, as best as you can. Run a knife through batter to make \"swirls\".",
    "Bake at 350 degrees F, for 23-25 minutes, or until...I don't know. Brownies are difficult to judge. They'll be done. Don't worry. Just take them out at 25 minutes.",
