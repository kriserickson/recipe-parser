    "Heat the olive oil in a deep pan over medium high heat. Add the onions and saute for 2-3 minutes until soft and fragrant. Add the chicken, curry paste, garam masala, ginger, and garlic. Stir fry for another 3-5 minutes to get the chicken pieces browned.",
    "Add the tomato puree, broth, eggplant, tomatoes, and quinoa. Cover and smmer for 15-20 minutes (check the quinoa package for cook time - mine was a sprouted quinoa that cooked in 15 minutes). When it's done, it will look like the picture above - sort of like a stew.",
    "When the chicken and quinoa are both cooked through, serve in big bowls topped with ALL THE THINGS. We like rice, cilantro, green onions, and crushed almonds for crunch."
