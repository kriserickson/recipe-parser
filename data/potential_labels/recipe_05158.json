    "Perform vaghar: heat the oil in the pan, when it is hot enough, add the cumin. You will know it is hot enough because when you drop in one cumin seed tiny bubbles fizzle around it. Let the cumin toast in the pan for about 10 seconds, until you smell the toastiness, but don’t burn the seeds.",
    "Add the garlic and stir a bit.",
    "When the garlic is a little brown, throw in the mung beans and add remaining ingredients. Saute for about a minute or so, just to brown it a bit and let the flavors develop.",
    "Notes:",
    "For a softer, less crunchy saute, add a couple of tablespoons of water, cover and let cook about 5 minutes.",
    "I would encourage you to throw in anything else you might want in this dish. Add some onions with the garlic if you want, some chilies or maybe some ginger, it’s a very flexible dish.",
    "In the pictures we topped the beans with spring onions and a little parsley. Why not? Cilantro would be great in this too!"
