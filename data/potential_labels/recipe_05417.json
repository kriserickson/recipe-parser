    "Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5.\nTip the cream, milk and garlic into a large\nsaucepan and bring to a simmer. Slice the\npotatoes very finely, about 3-4mm, add\nthem to the cream and simmer for 3 mins\nuntil just cooked. Gently stir to separate\nthe potato and stop it sinking and\ncatching on the bottom of the pan.",
    "Remove the potatoes with a slotted\nspoon and place in a wide shallow\novenproof dish so that they are about\n5cm in depth. Pour over the garlic infused\ncream (discarding the garlic) – just enough\nto seep through the layers and leave a\nlittle moisture on the surface. Scatter\nover the cheese, if using, then bake for\n30 mins until the potatoes are soft and\nbrowned – increase the heat for 5 mins\nif not brown enough."
