    "Instructions",
    "To start the gravy, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook for 20-25 minutes, until mostly caramelized.",
    "Meanwhile, make the biscuits. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl mix together the almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the almond milk and coconut oil.",
    "In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold into the flour mixture until combined. Scoop about 1/4 cup of dough onto the baking sheet to form approximately 8 biscuits. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the oven and set aside.",
    "Once the onions are caramelized, add the almond flour and arrowroot to the pan and stir. Cook for one minute, and then stir in the chicken broth, oregano, and garlic powder. Simmer until thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If desired, blend the gravy in a food processor until smooth. Serve warm drizzled over the biscuits.",
