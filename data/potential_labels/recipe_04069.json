    "Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make thin cutlets. Pound the cutlets between two sheets of plastic wrap to flatten them slightly. Season with salt and pepper. Place the flour in a shallow dish and coat the chicken on all sides.",

    "Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and brown on both sides (about 3 minutes per side). Remove the chicken to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.",

    "Add the wine, lemon juice, lemon zest, and capers to the pan. Scrape up all browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Season the sauce with salt and pepper, if needed. Pour the sauce over the chicken, and sprinkle with parsley."
