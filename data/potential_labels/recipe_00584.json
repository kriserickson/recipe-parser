    "Spread bread crumbs on a rimmed baking sheet and place into the oven. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F, toasting bread crumbs while the oven preheats. Timing will depend on the oven, but it should take about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the baking sheet when bread crumbs are lightly golden, stirring once (watch carefully so crumbs don't burn).",
    "Meanwhile, stir together lemon zest, oil, basil, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Stir in toasted bread crumbs and mix until evenly blended. Brush the baking sheet lightly with additional oil.",
    "Pat fillets dry with paper towels. Coat both sides of fillets by pressing into crumb mixture in the bowl and then place them onto the oiled baking sheet. Press remaining crumbs on top of fillets. Bake until fish is opaque and flakes easily, about 15 minutes."
