    "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.",
    "On baking sheet, toss squash with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Scatter with thyme springs and roast until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Discard thyme.",
    "Meanwhile, season steak generously with salt and pepper. Grease a grill pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil and heat over high heat. Grill steak 5 to 6 minutes per side for medium rare. Let sit 5 minutes, then slice thinly diagonally.",
    "Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together vinegar and honey, then slowly whisk in remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "In a large bowl, drizzle spinach and roasted squash with 2/3 of the vinaigrette, tossing gently to combine. (Add more vinaigrette if you like.) Divide mixture among 4 plates and top with grilled steak and blue cheese. Serve immediately."
