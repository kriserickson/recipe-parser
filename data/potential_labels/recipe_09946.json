    "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt and yeast.",
    "Add water and mix until a shaggy mixture forms.",
    "Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 12 - 18 hours. Overnight works great.",
    "Heat oven to 450 degrees. When the oven has reached 450 degrees place a cast iron pot with a lid in the oven and heat the pot for 30 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, pour dough onto a heavily floured surface and shape into a ball.",
    "Cover with plastic wrap and let set while the pot is heating. Remove hot pot from the oven and drop in the dough.",
    "Cover and return to oven for 30 minutes.",
    "After 30 minutes remove the lid and bake an additional 15 minutes. Remove bread from oven and place on a cooling rack to cool.",
    "A few notes:",
    "IF you do not have instant or Rapid-rise and you only have regular active dry yeast, THEN proof the yeast before you use it by mixing the yeast with 1/4 cup warm water. Let it set for 5 minutes then mix the yeast in with the water.",
    "Don't over mix. Remember it's \"NO-knead\".",
    "Note: the dough is super sticky.",
    "Heavily flour a surface. I'm using a pastry cloth, which is nothing more than canvas with the edges surged. You can use your counter top, a bread board, whatever works. Just flour the daylights out of it.",
    "If you have a dough scraper, use it.",
    "IMPORTANT: Do NOT knead the bread. Remember it's \"NO-knead\"."
