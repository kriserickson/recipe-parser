    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Place raspberries in a sieve set over a bowl. Let stand on the counter to thaw a little. Push berries through sieve using the bottom of a ladle. Discard seeds. Stir maple syrup into raspberry purée.",
    "Stir flour with oat bran, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl until mixed. Whisk egg in a medium bowl. Whisk in ricotta, milk, vanilla, and 4 T oil. Make a well in flour mixture. Pour in egg mixture and stir just until blended.",
    "Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium. Lightly brush with remaining oil as needed. When hot, scoop about ¼ c batter into pan. Repeat for each pancake. You should be able to fit 2-3 in the pan. Cook until bubbles form on the top, 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown, about 2 more minutes. Reduce heat if pancakes are browning too quickly. Remove to a platter. Cover and keep warm until serving. Serve with raspberry sauce."
