    "While chicken is cooking, boil pasta according to package and chop the veggies.",
    "Heat the olive oil in a deep skillet over medium-low heat. When oil is hot enough, add onions and cook them for about 3-5 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper and cook for another 3-5 minutes. Next, add cooked chicken, green chiles, cumin, chili powder, salt, & enchilada sauces. Let sauce simmer for about 8-10 minutes. After you let it simmer, add cheese and stir until the cheese is melted and heated through. Next, add in the sour cream and cook on low heat to avoid the sour cream curdling. Stir until sour cream is well mixed and heated through.",
