    "Add chickpeas, parsley, shallot, garlic, sesame seeds, cumin, salt, pepper (and coriander and cardamom if using) to a food processor or blender and mix/pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed until thoroughly combined. You’re looking for a crumbly dough, not a paste (see photo).",
    "Add flour 1 Tbsp at a time and pulse/mix to combine until no longer wet and you can mold the dough into a ball without it sticking to your hands - I used 4 Tbsp.",
    "Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a bit more salt, pepper, and a dash of cardamom and coriander. You want the flavor to be pretty bold, so don’t be shy.",
    "Transfer to a mixing bowl, cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours to firm up. If you’re in a hurry you can skip this step but they will be a little more fragile when cooking.",
    "Once chilled, scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts (~30 g in weight // I used this scoop) and gently form into 11-12 small discs.",
    "Optional: Sprinkle on panko bread crumbs and gently press to adhere - flip and repeat. This will produce a crispier crust but is optional.",
    "Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough oil to generously coat the pan - about 2 Tbsp. Swirl to coat.",
    "Once the oil is hot, add only as many falafel as will fit very comfortably in the pan at a time - about 5.",
    "Cook for a total of 4-5 minutes, flipping when the underside is deep golden brown. Repeat until all falafel are browned - the deeper golden brown they are, the crispier they'll be. They will also firm up more once slightly cooled.",
    "Serve warm with garlic-dill sauce or hummus, inside a pita with desired toppings or atop a bed of greens.",
    "Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep in the refrigerator covered for several days. Freeze after that to keep fresh for up to 1 month."
