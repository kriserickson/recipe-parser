    "Bake until bananas have dried out, 2-3 hours. Check bananas after about 90 minutes and peel up from the parchment paper to help air circulate a bit better (I used my fingers as the bananas are still a bit moist).",
    "Remove from oven and let cool for another 30-60 minutes (banana chips with crisp more as they cool.) If you remove the banana chips too soon and they do not start to crisp after about 5 minutes of being out of the oven, return to the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes."
