    "Instructions",
    "To the Instant Pot, add the chicken, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, water, brown sugar, and sesame oil. Give it a quick mix.",
    "Cover with the lid, and make sure that the Instant Pot vent is in sealing position.",
    "Press on \"manual\" or \"pressure cook\", set on high pressure, and cook for 3 minutes. Let the Instant Pot come to pressure, then it will stop cooking and will beep. Quickly release the steam and carefully open the lid.",
    "To thicken the sauce:",
    "Press on \"saute\" setting, and add the slurry to the pot. Mix it with the sauce, and the sauce will be thickened. If it's not thick enough, then add one more tbsp of cornstarch with water mixed together before adding to the pot.",
    "Stir in the broccoli and cover with the lid to let it \"steam\" for a couple of minutes. Serve over rice, and garnish with toasted sesame seeds."
