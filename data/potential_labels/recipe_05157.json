    "DIRECTIONS:",
    "In a 6-quart oval crock pot place your chicken breast along the bottom in a single layer. Add chicken broth and then top each chicken breast with one slice of cheese.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together cream soups an milk. Add on top of chicken and cheese.",
    "Top with box of stuffing mix.",
    "Cook on low for 6-8 hrs or High for 4 hrs. Or until chicken is completely done.",
    "Serve with you choice of side. We usually serve this with green beans or broccoli and I get around 8 servings out of the pot, cutting the chicken breasts in half.",
    "NOTES:",
    "You can really use any type of stuffing mix that you like. There are all sorts of varieties out there.",
    "For cheese, I usually use mozzarella, provolone, or jack â€“ but again, you could also use a cheese with a stronger flavor like swiss.",
    "I have shared the video to our youtube channel as well, so that you can easily see how I layer the ingredients in the pot."
