    "In a large bowl, combine the chickpea flour, the plant-based milk, the water, the garlic power, the paprika powder, the salt, and the black pepper.",
    "Cut the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Dip the florets into the batter, so they're completely coated. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lay the cauliflower florets on the baking sheet. Don't put them on top of each other. Bake for 25 minutes.",
    "Remove them from the oven and dip them in the spicy BBQ sauce. Coat evenly. Put them back on the baking sheet. If you want them to be even spicier drizzle a bit of sriracha sauce on top. Bake for another 25 minutes.",
    "Sprinkle with the green onions and serve with vegan aioli or vegan ranch sauce. Enjoy!"
