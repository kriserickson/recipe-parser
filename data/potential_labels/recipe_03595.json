Add the tomato\npurée and Worcestershire sauce, then\nfry for a few mins. Pour over the stock,\nbring to a simmer, then cover and\ncook for 40 mins, uncovering halfway.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/\nfan 160C/ gas 4, then make the mash.\nBoil the potatoes in salted water for\n10-15 mins until tender. Drain, then\nmash with the butter and milk.",
    "Put the mince into an ovenproof dish,\ntop with the mash and ruffle with a fork.\nThe pie can now be chilled and frozen\nfor up to a month.
