    "Sift dry ingredients together. Cut in the butter and shortening with a fork or pastry cutter until the crumbles become pea sized. In a separate bowl mix together the egg, vinegar, and ice water until thoroughly blended. Add this mixture to your butter mixture until well blended. Divide into two balls for large pies or into three balls for smaller pies. Refrigerate the dough balls for at least an hour, covered with plastic wrap. Roll out and set in your pie plate and prick the dough with a fork. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes at 425 degrees or until lightly brown. (Or bake for 10 minutes, cover the edges with tin foil or pie shields, and then bake for the remaining 10 minutes.)"
