    "Preheat the oven to 175°C. Grease a 8x4\" loaf tin and line the bottom with parchment paper. Flour the tin.",
    "In a medium size bowl, sift the flour, salt, baking soda, ground cinnamon, ground cloves and ground ginger. In a larger bowl, mix the mashed bananas, sugar, eggs, oil, water and vanilla extract until well combined. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and stir until everything is well combined, being careful not over mixing the batter.",
    "Fold in the chocolate chips and walnuts. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin and bake for 55 mins or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. If the bread starts to brown too much, cover with foil and continue to bake until cooked through.",
    "Let the bread cool in the tin for about 10 minutes, before removing it from it. Let the bread cool out of the tin on a baking wire rack.",
    "Store it in a paper bag or wrapped in foil and keep in the fridge for over a week or slice it and freeze it for a month."
