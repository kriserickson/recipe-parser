    "Trim chicken breasts of fat, and slice into strips to resemble chicken tenders.",
    "Add marinade ingredients to a zip-top plastic bag and whisk to combine. Add chicken to bag, and seal, pressing out any excess air. Smoosh the bag around a bit to make sure all the chicken pieces are coated in the marinade. Place bag on a plate and refrigerate up to 8 hours.",
    "Pour entire contents of the bag into a large skillet and heat over MED-HIGH heat until the mixture comes to a bubble. Reduce heat to MED-LOW and simmer, uncovered, for about 25-30 minutes, until most of the liquid cooks off, leaving a loose glaze.",
    "The last 5 minutes or so, add in the sliced bell pepper, jalapeño and orange slices and let them cook in the glaze.",
    "Remove chicken, veggies and oranges to a plate. Serve over rice, quinoa, or as is for a low carb option. If desired, garnish with sliced green onions, minced parsley, and a lime wedge."
