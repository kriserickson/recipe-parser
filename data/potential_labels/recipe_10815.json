    "Directions",
    "Preheat oven to 400F. Lightly spray around the tops of 6 cups of a standard muffin tin with baking or oil spray. Line them with six paper liners or spray the cups as well.",
    "Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.",
    "Whisk the egg and sugar until pale and fluffy, a.k.a the “ribbon stage” (When the egg/sugar mixture drips in thick ribbons off the whisk). Pour in the oil and milk/buttermilk and whisk to combine.",
    "Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture with a rubber spatula until just combined. Mix in the chocolate chunks. The batter should be thick and lumpy.",
    "Divide the batter among the paper liners such that they are overfilled in a dome as shown above. Sprinkle with raw sugar if desired. Let batter sit in pan for 5 minutes.",
    "Bake in preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until a tester inserted into into the center of a muffin comes out clean (Watch out, a wet tester may just be due to melted chocolate!). Let cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then finish cooling on a wire rack. (Or eat warm after the first 10 minutes!)"
