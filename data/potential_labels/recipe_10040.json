    "Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days.",
    "(Optional modifications: If you're worried about the salsa being too spicy, just add in half of a (seeded) jalapeno to start, and then see if you want to add more. If you want more heat, add in the entire jalapeno with seeds, or even add in two jalapenos. If you want it extra \"smoky\", add in 1-2 chipotles in adobo sauce.)"
