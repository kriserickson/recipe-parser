    "Peel the shallots, then slice them in half from root to tip. Warm the olive oil in a heavy based shallow pan, then lightly brown the shallots on both sides. Keep the heat moderate. Halve then quarter the courgettes lengthways and cut into large dice. Peel and finely slice the garlic. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.",
    "When the shallots are soft, push them to one side of the pan and add the courgettes and sliced garlic to the other, letting them lightly colour. Cut the tomatoes in half. When the courgettes are pale gold, add the tomatoes, halved, and the sprigs of thyme and oregano, and let them cook for a minute or two then transfer the whole pan to the oven.",
    "Bake the vegetables for 25 minutes until the tomatoes are soft and the vegetables are truly tender. Remove the pan from the oven and make two small, shallow hollows among the vegetables, then crack an egg into each of them. Return the vegetables and eggs to the oven for 4-5 minutes, until the eggs are just set."
