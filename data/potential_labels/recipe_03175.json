    "It’s time to go with the grain for faster summer body gains. Grab your pan and sauté onion and garlic for 2min, then throw in the freekeh and quinoa. Both pack a protein payload and fat-searing nutrients, which your core will thank you for.",
    "Add the stock, one ladle at a time, gradually bringing it to the boil. Simmer for 15min, stirring intermittently. Add the lemon juice, veg and bubble for another 5min.",
    "Bung in the fish and poach for 10min. Mix in the cheese and give it all a good stir. Now plate up and take a good sniff before you stuff your face and cut your waist."
