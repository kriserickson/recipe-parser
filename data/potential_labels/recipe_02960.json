In a large pot or fryer, heat oil to 350 degrees F. Par-fry the potatoes for 8 to 10 minutes or until brown.

    "For Paula's Mozzarella Sticks:",
    "Stir the breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup of Parmesan, thyme, basil, oregano and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a medium bowl to blend. Dip the cheese in the eggs to coat completely and allow the excess egg to drip back into the bowl. Coat the cheese in the bread crumb mixture, patting to adhere and coat completely. Place the cheese sticks on a baking sheet. Repeat dipping the cheese sticks in the egg and bread crumb mixture to coat a second time. Cover and freeze until frozen, about 2 hours and up to 2 days.",
