    "• My husband reacts to gluten so this salad is a gluten-free version of tabbouleh salad. We have this often and we both love it with quinoa.",
    "• Cook the quinoa as directed and place in a large bowl to let cool.",
    "• Mix the lemon juice, mint, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Once mixed, continue whisking/stirring and drizzel the olive oil making sure the mixture does not separate.",
    "• Pour dressing over the cooked quinoa and stir making sure all of the grains are covered with the liquid.",
    "• Add the remaining ingredients and stir until thoughoughly mixed. Once mixed, place in the fridge for several hours to enable the flavours to mix.",
    "The hardest part of this recipe is waiting to eat it!"
