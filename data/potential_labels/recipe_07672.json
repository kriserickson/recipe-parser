    "Recipe: Grilled Chicken with Pineapple Avocado Salsa",
    "August 28, 2014 – Hi everyone! It’s Ali from Gimme Some Oven. And I’m stoked to be back with you today, sharing a recipe with my all-time favorite thing to buy at ALDI — pineapple!!",
    "Oh my goodness, I hope you all have discovered the fabulousness that is fresh and super-reasonably-priced pineapple. It was one of the very first things that sold me on shopping at ALDI way back in the day. They are always in stock, usually at least half the price (or less) of fresh pineapple at other grocery stores, and they are so sweet and satisfying!",
    "I actually decided to make it a tradition to pick up a fresh pineapple as a treat every time I shopped at ALDI years ago. And now, years later, I think it’s safe to say I have literally purchased hundreds of fresh pineapples from the store. My friends even joke that an ALDI pineapple is part of the permanent decor in my kitchen.",
    "Ok, now you all may think that I’m the Crazy Pineapple Lady. But for those who also love pineapple, or even those of you who just reasonably “like” it, I have a recipe to share today that is perfect for summer grilling — Grilled Chicken with Pineapple Salsa. (Or since ALDI carries pineapple year-round, you can even pop this on the grill pan in the winter and just pretend it’s summer.)",
    "Basically, you just grill up some chicken breasts and then top them with a fresh, flavorful and easy pineapple salsa. (I highly recommend making a double-batch of the salsa for leftovers!) It’s a perfect dish for a summer weeknight, or even a simple crowd-pleaser if you’re entertaining. And of course, it’s a great excuse to pick up some of that famous pineapple.",
    "I hope you enjoy it!",
