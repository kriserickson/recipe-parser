    "Combine the flour and cayenne in a shallow bowl. Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet on medium flame until hot.",
    "Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess flour. Place the chicken in the hot skillet and cook until lightly golden, about 3 minutes.",
    "Turn the chicken over, add the lemon juice, lemon slices, garlic, olives, 1 1/2 tablespoons of the parsley, and the salt and pepper. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally and stirring the olive mixture gently to avoid burning the garlic.",
    "Add the butter to the pan, shaking to combine the sauce.",
    "Place the chicken breasts on a serving plate, then pour the olive mixture over the top. Garnish with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of the fresh parsley.",
