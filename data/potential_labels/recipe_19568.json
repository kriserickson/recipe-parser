    "Combine all ingredients except the oil in a food processor fitted with the blade attachment and blend until combined, 5-10 seconds.",
    "While the food processor is still running, add the cold oil in a very slow, steady stream. It should take about a minute to add all of the oil.",
    "When all of the oil is incorporated, the mixture should be thick, emulsified, and a pale yellowish-white. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.",
    "Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.",
    "You can also make mayonnaise without a food processor. Do exactly the same thing, but use a mixing bowl and a whisk instead."
