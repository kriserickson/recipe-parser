    "Place the ginger, garlic and green chilli in a wet grinder and blend to a smooth paste.",
    "Mix the yogurt with the gram flour in a bowl to get rid of any lumps, until you have a thick paste.",
    "Add the ginger, garlic and chilli paste, the paprika, chilli powder, garam masala and coriander powder. Also mix in the ground cinnamon, saffron and salt.",
    "Stir well and tip in the chicken pieces and mix well, making sure to coat them in the thick marinade. Leave to marinate for a few hours or even overnight if you prefer.",
    "Soak wooden skewers in water. Preheat the grill to medium. Shake off the excess marinade and thread the chicken pieces onto the skewers and place them on a wire rack.",
    "Cook under the grill for 15-20 minutes. Turn the skewers every 5 minutes and baste with melted butter until the chicken juices run clear and the pieces are cooked through and slightly charred around the edges.",
    "Serve warm over roti or parathas sprinkled with chaat masala and lemon juice along with mint chutney and salad."
