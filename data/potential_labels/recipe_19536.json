    "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. For the rolls, make up the bread mix following pack instructions, then roll out to a 30 x 40cm rectangle. Spread over the curry paste, then roll up, starting with the longest edge, like a roly poly. Cut into 8 slices and transfer to a lightly oiled baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 mins or until golden and cooked through.",
    "Meanwhile, make the soup. Fry the curry paste and onion in a large pan for 2 mins until fragrant. Stir in the carrots and lentils and mix to coat in the curry paste. Cook for 2 mins, then pour in the stock and simmer for 20 mins until the lentils are tender. Whizz with a stick blender until smooth, add some seasoning and serve with the curry pinwheels."
