    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "Line a large sheet pan with foil or parchment paper.",
    "Prep the veggies: chop the red potatoes (pretty small pieces here so they will be tender in time), trim the green beans and halve (see video above recipe), chop the broccoli, chop the peppers into thick squares, and coin the sausage in thick slices.",
    "Place all the veggies and sausage on a sheet pan. Pour the olive oil and all the spices on top. Toss to evenly coat all the veggies and meat.",
    "Bake 15 minutes, remove from the oven and flip/stir all the veggies around. Return to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are crisp tender and sausage is browned.",
    "If desired, sprinkle freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the veggies and sausage as soon as they come out of the oven.",
    "Enjoy with rice or quinoa and fresh parsley if desired."
