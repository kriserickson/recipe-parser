    "Brown the ground turkey on medium heat in large sauté pan and season with salt and pepper. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat up into small pieces.",
    "Add the chopped onions, garlic, pepper, tomato and cilantro and continue cooking on a low heat. Add alcaparrado (or olives and capers) and about 2 tbsp of the brine (this adds great flavor) cumin, oregano, bay leaves, and more salt if needed. Add tomato sauce and 1/4 cup of water and mix well. Reduce heat to low and simmer covered about 15 minutes.",
    "Preheat to oven to 350°F. Lightly spray a 9 x 9 baking dish with oil.",
    "Heat a large non-stick sauté pan over medium heat. When hot spray with oil to lightly coat the bottom. Cook plantains for 2-3 minutes on each side or until golden; set aside.",
    "Assemble by layering the plantains, then the cooked turkey picadillo, then about 1/4 cup of cheese and repeat. You want to finish with a layer of plantains. Beat the egg and egg whites with 2 tbsp of milk and pour over the pastelón to help bind everything, letting it sit for a minute or two to soak in.",
    "Top off with the remaining cheese. Cover tight with foil and bake in the oven 30 to 35 minutes, or until completely heated through. Cut into 9 equal pieces and serve."
