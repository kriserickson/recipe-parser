    "The night before, peel your bananas and cut them into small chunks. Transfer the chunks to a plastic bag or container and place them in the freezer. Then, add all the remaining ingredients to the bowl of your blender and give them a stir to ensure that everything is well combined. Cover and place in the fridge for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.",
    "The next morning, remove your blender bowl from the fridge and add the frozen banana chunks. Blend on high until a smooth and creamy consistency is reached, adding more milk if the smoothie is too thick. Transfer to a bowl or glass, add desired toppings, and enjoy!"
