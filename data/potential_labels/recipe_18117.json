    "In a pressure cooker, add oil, onions, carrots, celery and garlic and saute 4-5 minutes. Add ham bone, peas, water, chicken bouillon and bay leaf. Cover and cook high pressure for 15 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally then open, remove the bone and bay leaf and stir, the soup will thicken as it stands.",
    "Saute the ham on a hot skillet if desired and use for garnish on the soup with chives.",
    "To make without a pressure cooker, add 2 more cups water and simmer covered on low for 2 hours."
