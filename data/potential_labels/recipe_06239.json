    "In a resalable plastic bag, combine 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, lemon juice, lime juice, garlic, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, hot sauce to taste, salt and pepper to taste, and steak meat. Seal and toss the bag around to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours. Remove the meat from the marinade and place it on the hot grill. Cook steak for about 3 minutes on each side or until fully cooked through. Slice the steak into strips.",
    "In a large skillet, heat up the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and fry the onions and bell peppers until crisp-tender with the salt and pepper for seasoning. When ready to serve, place meat into skillet and toss around with the vegetables for about a minute. Remove from stove and squeeze a bit of extra lime juice on top and serve with tortilla shells and toppings of choice."
