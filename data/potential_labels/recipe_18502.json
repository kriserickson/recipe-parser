    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 8x4 inch loaf pan with parchment paper or spray pan generously with nonstick cooking spray.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.",
    "In a separate large bowl, whisk together wet ingredients. NOTES: Make sure your coconut oil is melted and cooled otherwise it will become clumpy. This goes with your eggs too -- it’s best to run them under warm water for 1 minute to bring them to room temp before baking.",
    "Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix well to combine. Pour batter into loaf pan and spread out evenly. Bake for 40-45 minutes until tester comes out clean. Allow loaf to cool completely in the pan before removing.",
    "To make the dark chocolate glaze: Add dark chocolate bar to a small pot and place over low heat, stirring the chocolate frequently until completely melted and smooth. Pour over the loaf and spread evenly towards the sides. Garnish with zest from 1 orange. Cut into 10 slices and enjoy!"
