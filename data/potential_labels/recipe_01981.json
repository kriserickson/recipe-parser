    "Cut chicken thighs into 1/2 inch pieces.",
    "In a separate bowl, mix the marinade and pour over the chicken. Add salt to taste. Mix completely so that all the chicken pieces are covered. Let marinade for 1-2 hours.",
    "Drain and skewer a few chicken pieces on each bamboo skewer. Heat a non stick pan on med high until hot. Lower the heat to med/low and add a few skewers to the pan. Cook on one side for 3-5 minutes or until caramel brown. Turn over and cook second side until caramel brown. You will notice that as the chicken cooks, it first releases some liquid and then the liquid starts to caramelize. It will then coat the chicken. Make sure your heat is not too high when cooking the chicken.",
    "Baste with extra honey if you like and cook for an additional minute or so. Sprinkle sesame seeds and serve.You can keep them warm in a 200 deg oven."
