    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 11- or 12-inch tart or pizza pan with parchment paper or grease with cooking spray.",
    "Space out dough on tart pan and press to form crust using parchment paper to help keep the dough from sticking to your fingers. Bake for 16 to 20 minutes (12-inch pan) or 20 to 25 minutes (11-inch pan), or until crust is light golden brown. Set aside to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Remove from tart pan and carefully remove parchment paper before placing on serving plate.",
    "In a small bowl, beat together cream cheese, sugar and vanilla. Spread onto cooled crust. Decorate with fruit, making sure it has been dried well after washing.",
    "For glaze, bring preserves and water to a boil in small saucepan or in microwave. Remove from heat and pour into a fine strainer, pressing it through to remove lumps. Brush glaze lightly over fruit then serve or refrigerate. You will have extra glaze."
