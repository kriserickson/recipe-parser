    "Let’s start by roasting the sweet potatoes in an oven. Preheat it to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and slice the sweet potatoes in the center. After 30 minutes, you can remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and peel the skin off. Once they are cool, roughly chop them and keep them aside.",
    "In a small saucepan, cook your quinoa and set aside to cool.",
    "Next, use a food processor to grind the oats.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the sweet potatoes, quinoa, chopped onion, cilantro leaves, black beans, cumin powder, chili powder, paprika powder, and some salt. Mix all of the ingredients together and ensure there aren’t any large lumps.",
    "Next, add the oats and mix it well.",
    "Start making the patties and place them in the refrigerator for some time, so that they are firm. (Think a couple of hours, at least)",
    "Use a pan to fry the patties with some oil. Flip them till they are golden brown on each side-- approximately minutes on each side.",
    "Now you can toast the buns if you like, and start assembling your burger with your favorite toppings like vegan cheese, mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomato, avocado-- the works!"
