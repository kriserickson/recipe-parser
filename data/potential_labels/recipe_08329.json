    "In a small bowl mix together garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Place shrimp in a large bowl and season with 3/4 of the spice mixture, tossing to evenly coat. Working with one shrimp at a time, make a slit about 3/4-inch long as base of shrimp. Place one jalapeno slice in cut slit, then wrap base of shrimp all the way around with half a slice of bacon. Repeat with rest of shrimp. Thread shrimp onto skewers and season lightly with remaining spice mixture. Brush shrimp lightly with coconut oil. Grill shrimp over high heat until bacon crisps and shrimp just cook through, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove to a platter and serve with lime wedges.",
