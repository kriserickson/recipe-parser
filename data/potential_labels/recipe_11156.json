    "Heat the oil in a medium, heavy-based saucepan or flameproof casserole over a medium to high heat. When hot, fry the wild boar in 2 batches until well browned on all sides. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon and transfer to a large bowl.",
    "Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion, carrot, celery and pancetta and fry gently for 8-10 minutes, stirring frequently. Increase the heat, pour in the wine and simmer until reduced by half. Add the tomatoes, stock and tomato puree and bring to the boil.",
    "Return the meat to the pan with any juices. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat, cover and simmer gently for one hour, stirring occasionally. Add the fennel seeds, re-cover and cook for one further hour. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Cook the rigatoni in a large pan of boiling, salted water until al dente. Drain the pasta thoroughly and tip it back into the same pan. Pour over the sauce and stir for 30 seconds to combine.",
    "Divide the rigatoni between 6 warmed bowls or plates. Sprinkle over the parmesan and serve immediately."
