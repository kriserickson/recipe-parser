    "Toast the coriander and cumin seeds in a small frying pan over a medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, then tip into a pestle and mortar and bash to a coarse powder.",
    "Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic, then add to the frying pan over a medium heat with a splash of oil. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden, then place into a food processor with the toasted spices.",
    "Coarsely grate the courgettes, place into a colander in the sink, then sprinkle with a good pinch of fine sea salt. Squeeze the mixture together with your hands to get rid of the excess moisture, then add to the processor. Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, then add half the coriander stalks to the processor with the chickpeas, breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pulse until combined, but not smooth – you want to retain a bit of texture.",
    "Transfer to a clean work surface then, with wet hands, divide and shape the mixture into eight little fat fingers. Place onto a tray, then pop in the fridge to chill for around 20 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, make the minty yoghurt dip. Halve the cucumber lengthways, scoop out and discard the watery seeds, then roughly chop. Pick and finely slice the mint leaves, then place into a bowl with the cucumber, yoghurt and a squeeze of lemon juice. Mix well.",
    "To make the nutty sauce, peel and finely slice the onion and garlic, then finely slice the remaining coriander stalks. Place into a large frying pan over a medium heat with a splash of oil, then cook for a few minutes, or until golden. Add the cashew nuts and toast for a further 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a food processor. Add the coconut milk and peanut butter, then blitz until thick and smooth.",
    "Return the large frying pan to a medium heat with a splash of oil. Once hot, add the kofte and cook for around 2 minutes, or until golden and piping hot through, turning regularly. Divide the kofte between your plates, tear over the coriander leaves, then serve with the nutty sauce and minty yoghurt dip and lemon wedges for squeezing. Delicious with pitta breads or fluffy rice."
