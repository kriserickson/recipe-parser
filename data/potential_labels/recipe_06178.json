    "1 Place beets in a medium saucepan and cover with an inch of water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to maintain a low simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of the beets, until easily pierced with the tines of a fork. When done, drain, peel off the outer thick skin, and let the beets cool to room temp.",
    "2 Whisk together the citrus vinaigrette ingredients in a small bowl.",
    "3 When the beets are cool and you are ready to serve, cut the beets in half and the halves into wedges. Tip: use a plastic cutting board when cutting red beets. They will stain wooden cutting boards. Cut and peel the avocado, cut the avocado into chunks (see how to peel and cut an avocado).",
    "4 Slice the avocado into wedges. Toss the salad greens with half of the citrus vinaigrette. Arrange the dressed greens on serving plates. Arrange the beet wedges and avocado wedges on top of the salad greens. Sprinkle with chopped pistachios. Drizzle remaining vinaigrette over the salads."
