    "For the classic cocktail sauce: Stir the ketchup, horseradish, Worcestershire and some salt and pepper together in a bowl. Chill before serving.",
    "For the avocado crema: Put the yogurt, cilantro, avocados, lime juice and some salt in a food processor and mix until completely smooth. Gradually add the milk and keep blending until the desired consistency is reached. (You can add more or less milk as desired.)",
