    "Start by melting the butter in a 9 X 13 casserole dish. Once the butter is melted, mix in your dry macaroni. Next, top with shredded cheese, then add 6 cups of milk slowly. Place in the oven and bake for 1 hour. Remove and serve! You can definitely make 2 or 3 trays of this at a time in aluminum pans for easy cleanup! Perfect for summer BBQs and pot luck dinners."
