    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "Preheat oven to 180C (350F). Line baking tray with parchment paper.",
    "Mix spelt flour, baking soda and sea salt in a large bowl.",
    "In a separate bowl combine peanut butter, tahini, maple syrup, coconut oil and vanilla.",
    "Pour the peanut butter mixture over the flour mixture and fold to combine.",
    "Drop small rounded balls of dough (each of my dough balls were 15g-17g, or about a rounded ½ tablespoon) onto prepared baking tray.",
    "Press down on each one gently with the back of a fork.",
    "Bake for 10 minutes only (do not over-bake); the cookies will still be slightly soft but will harden as they cool.",
    "Let cool for 15 minutes.",
    "NOTES",
    "Preparation time does not include the time it would take to make your own peanut butter, as I did! You can replace the tahini with more peanut butter, if desired."
