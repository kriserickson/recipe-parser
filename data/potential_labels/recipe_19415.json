    "To make the Instant Pot Keto soup recipe: Set a 6-qt Instant Pot to saute mode. Add Italian sausage to the insert of the Instant Pot and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until sausage is lightly browned, about 3-5 minutes. Drain excess fat.",
    "Add garlic, onion, and oregano to the Instant Pot with the sausage meat. Cook, stirring constantly until onions have become translucent, about 2-3 minutes.",
    "Stir in pasta, chicken broth and sun-dried tomatoes; season with pepper, to taste.",
    "Select manual setting on your Instant Pot; adjust the pressure to high, and set the timer for 5 minutes. When finished cooking the sausage soup, do a quick-release.",
    "Select saute mode and stir in kale to the soup until wilted, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream until heated through, about 1 minute; then adjust seasoning of the Tuscan sausage soup with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve the Instant Pot Keto Sausage Soup immediately with fresh grated Parmesan and parsley. Enjoy!"
