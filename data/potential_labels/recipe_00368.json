    "In a large pan, heat oil on medium-high for 45 seconds. Sprinkle in asafoetida and allow it to sizzle for 30 seconds. Carefully add tomatoes, then stir and add salt, cumin, coriander, cayenne and turmeric. Sauté for 5 minutes, or until oil glistens on top.",
    "Add water, stir and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, stir in celery root, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in cauliflower, cover and cook for 5 more minutes. Pour in coconut milk, then bring back to a boil and stir in rapini. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, while stirring, then turn off the heat. Serve this hearty curry in big bowls over rice. Serves 6 to 8."
