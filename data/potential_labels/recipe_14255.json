    "Bring a pot of water to a boil and then lower to a bubbling simmer. Poach the eggs by dropping each egg gently in the water and cook for about 4-5 minutes. Make sure the water covers the eggs. Remove the eggs with a strainer. Set aside.",
    "Heat up the same pot and add the chicken broth. Bring it to boil. Add the kimchi, pepper paste, chili powder and ramen. When the ramen is about half done, add the mushroom and sesame oil. Add salt to taste. Transfer the noodles to two bowls and top with the poached eggs and scallions. Serve immediately."
