    "Here is my take on the missing directions",
    "Melt the butter in a sauce pan. Make a roux by adding the parmesan cheese to the melted butter and blend.",
    "Add in the cream and milk stirring constantly till blended. Add in remaining sauce ingredients. Simmer on",
    "low do not boil.",
    "Layer the chips in an oven proof cooking vessel, pour sauce over chips and layer remaining nacho ingredients.",
    "Heat in a 350F oven till cheese is melted. Remove and enjoy.",

    "Instead of making a cream sauce, try a good quality alfredo Sauce. It tastes great.",
