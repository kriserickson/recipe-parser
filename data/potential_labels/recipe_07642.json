    "Wash brussels sprouts thoroughly and chop off the stems. Just remove the tough part without cutting into the sprout, this will keep the leaves in tact. Chop sprouts in half.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together maple syrup, sriracha, olive oil, salt, and ginger powder until well-combined.",
    "Heat oil in a large skillet [I recommend using a cast-iron if you have one!] on medium-high heat.",
    "Place brussels sprouts into the pan, cut side down. This step is important – it steams the sprouts faster and gives them a crispy texture all at the same time.",
    "For the next 5 minutes, gently stir the sprouts to keep them from sticking to the pan. If you notice the oil drying up, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons to the pan.",
    "After 5-8 minutes, check for browned edges – it's time to add the syrup.",
    "Pour in the syrup mixture and listen to it sizzle. Oh, how it sizzles. As soon as it hits the pan, it reacts with the heat and starts to transform. Stir the sprouts, coating them in the mixture until it thickens and starts to get sticky.",
    "Continue cooking for 1-2 minutes. Remove a sprout to test for tenderness – when they're cooked to your liking, remove from the heat and serve!"
