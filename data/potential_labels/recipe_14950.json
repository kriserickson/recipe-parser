    "1 In a large, shallow sauté pan, heat on medium high. Add the cashews and spread out in an even layer. Toast, stirring occasionally until lightly browned here and there, and you smell the aroma of the toasted cashews. Remove from the pan to a bowl.",
    "2 Add a couple tablespoons of olive oil to the pan. Heat on medium. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.",
    "3 Increase the heat to high/medium high. Add a couple tablespoons more of olive oil to the pan. Add the red pepper flakes. Add the roughly chopped kale. Use tongs to turn the kale leaves over so that they are all coated with olive oil. Cook just a couple minutes, turning the leaves over often, until they are just beginning to wilt. Sprinkle on lemon juice and salt. Remove from heat. Stir in the cashews.",
    "Taste and add more salt and lemon juice to taste."
