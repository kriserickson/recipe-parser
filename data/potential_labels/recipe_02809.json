    "Donuts - Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees and lightly grease or spray a Nonstick 6-Cavity Donut Pan with cooking spray. Or, use a muffin pan.",
    "In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and optional salt.",
    "Add buttermilk, egg, vanilla and melted butter. Whisk to combine.",
    "Use a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip (or a Ziploc bag with a corner cut off) to pipe the batter into a 6-donut pan. Or just be extra neat and do this with a spoon (my preference).",
    "Bake 8 to 11 minutes, or until doughnuts spring back when touched are are set. Donuts will not be golden brown, but should be springy. Allow to cool slightly before removing from pan, about 5 minutes.",
    "Vanilla Cream Cheese Glaze - While donuts are baking or cooling, make the glaze by combining powdered sugar, cream cheese, vanilla extract, cinnamon, with a small splash milk. Whisk to combine, adding the milk as necessary, until desired consistency is achieved.",
    "Dip the donuts into the glaze. Donuts are best fresh, but will keep airtight at room temp for up to 3 days."
