    "In a ziploc bag add the chicken and enough dressing to coat the chicken. Allow to marinate at least two hours or up to 1 day.",

    "Meanwhile, place the pasta in a pot of salted, boiling water and cook until al dente. Drain the pasta, but keep it in the pot.",
    "Thinly slice the chicken and add it, the broccoli, and sun-dried tomatoes into the pot with the pasta. Toss with a little of the white balsamic citrus basil dressing until evenly coated. Top with a little Parmesan cheese to taste."
