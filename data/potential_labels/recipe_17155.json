    "Add onion, garlic, celery, carrots and chicken directly in to mixer bowl.",
    "Pour water, salt, pepper and bay leaf into mixer bowl, to the max line - this is roughly 900 g or 32 oz in the TM31, a bit more in the TM5. Cook for 60 min/90°C or 195°F/slowest speed/MC on. You can totally clean your kitchen and prepare your vegetables for serving now",
    "When cooking time has finished, remove your chicken to a thermal server and add your serving vegetables (except for the spinach and parsley) to the stock (I dont bother draining it, the stock vegetables are also delicious!). Cook for 10-15 min/90°C or 195°F/slowest speed/MC on. While the vegetables are cooking, carefully shred your meat from the bones without burning yourself, and discard the bones. Pour soup & vegetables over your chicken, spinach and parsley, season to taste if needed, and serve."
