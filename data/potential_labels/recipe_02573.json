    "Before you measure out the kimchi, squeeze out as much juice from the kimchi as you can, into a liquid measuring cup, this liquid is the \"kimchi juice\"Whisk the kimchi juice, gochujang and soy sauce together until the gochujang is completely dissolved.",
    "Drizzle the sesame oil on the rice and stir to break up any big clumps.",
    "Put the vegetable oil in a frying pan and heat over medium high heat until hot. Add the chopped kimchi and stir fry until the kimchi is starting to brown and is very fragrant. Add the rice and and stir-fry with a silicon spatula, pressing down on any clumps until the rice is uniform in color. Pour the kimchi juice mixture over the rice, and turn up the heat to high. Stir-fry, tossing the rice occasionally until the rice starts to brown, and doesn't stick together quite as much. Since kimchi varies in saltiness, taste the kimchi bokkeumbap and add more soy sauce if needed.",
    "When the fried rice is done, add the scallions and then plate. Top each serving with a sunny-side up egg."
