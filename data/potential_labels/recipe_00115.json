    "Line baking sheets with non-stick liner or baking parchment",
    "Set the oven to gas mark 4 or 180C",
    "Tip the butter and sugar into a bowl and beat them together until smooth.",
    "Add the beaten egg.",
    "Add the coconut to the creamed mixture and then the flour.",
    "Mix all the ingredients together to give a smooth, firmish dough.",
    "Divide the dough into 16 pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Flatten the balls to about 4-5cm (1 1/2-2in) in diameter and place them on the lined baking sheets. The cookies spread slightly during cooking, so don't place them too close together. Press half a glace cherry on top of each biscuit.",
    "Bake the biscuits in the centre of the oven for 15 mins (13 mins in a fan oven) or until they are a light-golden colour.",
    "Remove the baking sheet(s) from the oven and leave the biscuits to cool for a few minutes, and then slide them on to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "Storage and freezing tips: The biscuits may be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days. They can also be packed in a freezer container and frozen for up to 1 month. Allow the biscuits to defrost, and then warm them through in a hot oven to refresh them before serving."
