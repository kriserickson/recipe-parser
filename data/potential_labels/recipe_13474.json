    "Heat broiler. Place peppers, cut side down, on a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil, and season generously with salt. Broil peppers until blackened in spots but flesh is still firm, about 3 minutes. Remove from oven and turn down temperature to 400°. Drizzle ⅓ cup oil over peppers and roast until flesh is soft and silky in texture, 20–25 minutes. Let cool, then remove ribs and seeds; discard. Cut peppers into 1\" pieces and place in a large bowl. Add vinegar and toss to combine; taste and season with more salt if needed (makes about 5 cups).",
    "Spread hummus on a plate and top with about 1 cup roasted bell peppers (reserve remaining peppers for another use). Top with cooked chickpeas, drizzle with remaining 3 Tbsp. oil, and top with parsley. Sprinkle with Urfa pepper."
