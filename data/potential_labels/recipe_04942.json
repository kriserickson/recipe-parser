    "1Make the taco seasoning by combining the spices, cornstarch, and salt. Mix well to make sure the cornstarch is fully incorporated and there are no lumps.",
    "2Fry the taco shells: Heat your oven to 250°F. Line a baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels and place it in the warm oven. Heat the oil in a cast-iron skillet until it registers 350°F on a deep-frying thermometer. Fry 1 tortilla at a time, using tongs so you don’t get burned: Carefully lay a tortilla in the hot oil—try not to submerge it. Fry flat for about 15 seconds, then use your tongs to fold it in half. Fry an additional 30 seconds, flip over, and fry for a final 30 seconds.",
    "3At this point the tortilla should be browned lightly in spots but still flexible. Remove it from the oil and drain on your towel-lined baking sheet (try to stand the shells up if you can—it doesn’t always work).",
    "4Return the baking sheet to the oven to keep the shells warm. Continue until all the shells are fried. When finished, pour off most of the frying oil, but leave about 1 tablespoon behind in the skillet.",
    "5Set the skillet back over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook until softened, about 4 minutes.",
    "6Add the ground beef to the skillet. Break it up with a spatula and cook until browned, about 5 minutes.",
    "7Add the taco seasoning and stir it into the beef until combined.",
    "8Add the water and cook, uncovered, for a few minutes until the mixture is bubbling and has thickened.",
    "9Assemble your tacos!",
    "1",
    "1Preheat broiler to high. Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces. Peel onion and mince. Rinse carrot and parsnips and cut into small dice. Rinse chives and thinly slice. Pat beef dry with paper towel.",
    "2Place potatoes in a medium pot and cover with cold water. Add a generous pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and place in a large bowl. Add butter and cream and, using a potato masher or fork, mash until completely smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. Set aside.",
    "3While potatoes cook, heat a large high-sided ovenproof pan over medium-high heat. When pan is just smoking, add beef, season with salt and pepper, and cook, breaking up with the back of a spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl.",
    "4Wipe pan from beef clean and add olive oil over medium-high heat. When oil is shimmering, add onion, carrot, and parsnips. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Return beef to pan and stir to combine. Stir in tomato paste and cook until brick red, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together chicken base with water.",
    "5Reduce heat to medium and sprinkle flour evenly over beef and vegetables. Stir until completely combined, about 1 minute. Slowly pour over chicken base mixture and Worcestershire sauce. Stir and cook until sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat.",
    "6Spread mashed potatoes evenly over beef. Place pan under broiler and cook until potatoes are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle over chives. Serve Shepherd’s Pie hot, family style."
