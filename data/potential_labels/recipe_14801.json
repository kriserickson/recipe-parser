    "preheat oven to 400˚F. peel the potatoes and cut then into small ¾″ cubes. toss with enough olive oil to coat all the pieces, then generously season with salt and fresh pepper. lay the cubes out on a parchment lined baking sheet in one layer. bake for 20-25 minutes flipping the potatoes half way through. to brown and crisp them a bit more, broil on high for 2-4 minutes.",
