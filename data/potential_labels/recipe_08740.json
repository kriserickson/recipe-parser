    "I thoroughly soaked all four dish rags with full strength Downy. (You can use whatever kind you want. I think next time I will try my Homemade Fabric Softener. Don’t know why that didn’t occur to me until just now! DUH!)",
    "Allow the towels to dry THOROUGHLY! I took mine outside and draped them over a plastic chair. Even in this uber dry state I live in…they took awhile to dry COMPLETELY. Of course it didn’t help that a RAINSTORM came through and blew the chair over and got the towels WET! ugh. I finished the drying process indoors. :-) Here they are hanging from my mini-clothesline in my laundry room.",
    "Throw one sheet in with a load of clothes. You should be able to use each dryer sheet a dozen times or more, before it needs to be dipped and dried again"

    "I happened to have JUST ENOUGH Downy Fabric Softener left in this bottle to make this work. I have literally had this bottle for over a year because I dilute it so much I hardly use any of it."
