    "Directions",
    "Step 1",
    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with foil. Slice the eggplant into 1/4'' slices. Get out two bowls, one for the beaten egg and one for the almond meal and spices (oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper). Dip the eggplant slices into the egg and flip to coat both sides. Then dip that slice into the almond meal mixture and, again, flip to coat both sides. Place on foil lined baking sheet and repeat with remaining eggplant slices. Bake for 15 minutes, then flip the eggplant slices over and bake for an additional 5 minutes.",
    "Step 2",
    "While the eggplant is baking, make your avocado cream sauce. Place all the sauce ingredients into a blender or food processor: avocado, coconut milk, olive oil, lime juice, salt and pepper. Blend until smooth and until it has reached your desired consistency. Add a little more milk, and salt and pepper if desired.",
    "This is also a great time to poach your eggs.*",
    "Step 3",
    "Time to layer! Start with a half an english muffin and top that with one or two slices of eggplant. Add one poached egg and top with a generous amount of avocado cream. Garnish with a little chopped cilantro (or herb of choice) and repeat to create the rest of your eggs benedict!"
