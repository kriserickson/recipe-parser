    "Give 2 cups of pasta a quick rinse",
    "Mix in a medium nonstick saucepan 2 cup milk, 1 T butter, 1 t garlic powder, 1/2 t paprika and 1/2 t dry mustard",
    "Add 2 cups (about 8 oz of pasta). Bring to a light boil over medium high heat stirring frequently. As soon as it starts to boil. Reduce heat to simmer uncovered. Continue to stir frequently.",
    "The milk will absorb and cook away in about 15-20 minutes. As you approach this point, test pasta for tenderness. It will probably not be done yet. Add 1/4 of milk and continue to cook and frequent stirring. You may need to repeat this again. I took 25 minutes and a total of 2 1/2 cups of milk total to finish the pasta.",
    "When the pasta is tender, and the milk mostly absorbed, add 1 cup of cheese (your choice), remove from heat and cover for minutes. Give a good stir before serving."
