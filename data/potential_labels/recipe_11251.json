    "Cook the macaroni. Set a large pot of salted water over high heat. (Add enough salt to the water to make it taste like the ocean.) Bring the water to a boil. Add the macaroni. Stir for at least 1 minute to make sure the pieces do not stick together. Set the timer for 8 minutes.",
    "Set up the sauce. While the pasta is boiling, put the goat cheese, Cheddar and kale in the bottom of a large, wide bowl.",
    "Finish the dish. When the macaroni is tender but still has a bite (al dente), remove it from the pot with a Chinese spider or slotted spoon. Put it on top of the cheese and kale. Pour in about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of the water the macaroni cooked in. Let everything sit for 5 minutes. Stir the mixture until the macaroni is coated in a creamy sauce, with kale dotted through it.",
    "You can use any cheeses you like here. Just be sure to use one soft cheese, such as goat cheese or cream cheese. Try gruyere or pecorino in place of the Cheddar. And any dark greens, such as Swiss chard or spinach, will work well as a substitute for kale.",
