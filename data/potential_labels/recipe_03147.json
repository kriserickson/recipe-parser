Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce begins to thicken, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in 1/4 cup of the cheese until melted and smooth. Add the pasta and parsley, tossing until the pasta is well coated. Serve at once sprinkled with the remaining cheese."
