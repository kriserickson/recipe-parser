    "Preheat an oven to 325°F. Place tomatoes, garlic and basil on a rimmed baking sheet, and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Sprinkle with a large pinch of salt and several turns of black pepper, then toss to combine. Bake until the tomatoes are soft and wrinkled, 45 – 50 minutes, stirring the tomatoes around a few times to ensure even cooking.",
    "While the tomatoes are cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente (soft on the outside, but still some bite left on the inside). Place cooked pasta and tomato confit* in a large bowl, tossing to combine. Season to taste with additional kosher salt and black pepper (I added a couple additional pinches of salt).",
    "To serve, divide pasta between 4 bowls, and finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of chopped fresh basil."
