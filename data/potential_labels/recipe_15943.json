    "Wash, peel and cube your sweet potatoes. You WILL need a sharp peeler for these, sweet potatoes are hard. I bought a new one today just for this project because my other one was dull and difficult. A new (and very sharp peeler) cost me $2.97. Not too bad.",
    "STEP 2: Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Spray a casserole dish with non-stick spray and put all of your sweet potato chunks in it. In a separate bowl, mix the sesame oil, brown sugar, garlic, and soy sauce together until as much as the sugar is dissolved as possible.",
    "STEP 3: Pour the sauce over the sweet potato chunks and stir to coat all sides. Cover the dish with foil (or a cover if it has one) and place in the oven for 20 minutes.",
    "STEP 4: After 20 minutes, stir the mixture and place back in the oven without a cover. Stir every ten minutes after this point, cooking for 30 minutes more total. I added the sesame seeds at the last stir (with ten minutes left to cook).",
    "NOTE: A lot of people are afraid of “low carb” recipes but Kalyn’s Kitchen has some pretty rockin recipes. Look with an open mind and adjust as you feel necessary. In this recipe I just used 2 Tbsp of brown sugar instead of splenda. Cooking is versatile. Look at recipes and let your mind work to make the recipes work for you. Don’t be afraid!",
    "Oh, and enjoy these sweet potatoes because they are freakin’ amazing!"
