    "Add garlic, ginger or galangal, lime juice, oil, curry powder, tomato, salt, and chili. Blend until smooth and creamy. Adjust seasonings to taste.",
    "Add cilantro and pulse until cilantro is finely minced.",
    "Pour into serving containers and add any chopped veggies you like: bell pepper, tomatoes, and thinly sliced mushrooms work well.",
    "This raw coconut soup works well after it's had a chance to chill in the fridge for a couple of hours to allow the flavors to set. It'll need a good stirring before serving, however, as the oils and coconut water will tend to separate.",
    "Enjoy your raw food Thai coconut soup! Yum!"
