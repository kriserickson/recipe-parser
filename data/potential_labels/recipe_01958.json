    "With all the ingredients in the Cuisinart - pulse about 10-15 times, if you pulse (or blend) too much you will have spicy tomato soup (you want it a little chunky).",
    "Pour the Salsa into 3 medium (about 3 CUP) storage containers. I put about 2 1/2 cups into each of the containers (these are the small clear plastic with blue lid containers that you can find in almost any grocery store). You want to pour the Salsa into the containers soon after mixing or the heavier ingredients may settle to the bottom.",
    "Put the containers in the refrigerator and chill for 2-3 hours (the longer the better).",
    "Will keep for 3-4 days in the refrigerator."
