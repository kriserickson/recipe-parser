    "In a small saucepan, heat up 2 c. vegetable oil over medium heat. Line a plate with a paper towel (to absorb the oil) and place the cinnamon sugar coating over the towel. Set aside and have ready right next to the stove.",
    "Whisk the dry ingredients together. Add the wet ingredients into the dry mix and stir until just combined. The batter should be on the thick side and should not be overly sticky or wet.",
    "Place into a large plastic baggie with a corner cut out or a piping bag. Squeeze out a good 1½\"- 2\" sized poppers onto a piece of parchment paper. These batter should be able to stay within its shape without sticking to the paper or losing shape.",
    "You can test first to see if your oil is ready by throwing one popper into the pan. It should immediately sizzle and brown evenly within a minute.",
    "Throw in the poppers in small batches. Once nicely browned, drain using a slotting spoon. Place onto the plate with the cinnamon sugar and evenly coat. Repeat for the remainder churros.",
    "Best if served immediately and warm."
