    "Start by cooking the quinoa for ~ 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. If you don’t have vegetable broth, simply mix 200 ml of water with a teaspoon of vegetable broth powder or a vegetable broth cube.",
    "While the quinoa is cooking, make the sauce. Mix all the ingredients until well incorporated.",
    "Finely dice the onion and sauté in a splash of water in a pan over medium-high heat for ~5 minutes. Strain the black beans. Then, add the tomato puree, black beans and spices to the pan and let simmer for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Wash the vegetables. Cut the bell pepper into thin strips and the tomatoes into halves. If you want, you can mix half of the spinach with the quinoa.",
    "Assemble your bowl by first adding the spinach leaves, then the quinoa, black beans and vegetables. Drizzle the tahini sauce on top. Garnish with a few pumpkin seeds."
