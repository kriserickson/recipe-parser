    "Wash, peel and core quinces. Place peel and cores in TM Bowl and chop for 20 seconds on speed 5, using spatula to push the peel down.",
    "Cut quince flesh into chunks and place in Varoma tray.",
    "Add water to the TM bowl and position Varoma and cook for 25 minutes at Varoma Temperature on speed 1.",
    "Remove the Varoma tray and leave aside. Strain the peel and core mixture and collect the liquid in a separate bowl. Dispose of the pulp, clean the TM bowl and weigh in the liquid and pieces of quince into the TM bowl. Blend for 10 seconds on speed",
    "Add about three-quarters of the weight of pulp in sugar to the TM bowl. Mix for 15 seconds on speed 5.",
    "Cook for 50 minutes at Varoma temperature on Speed 5 with the MC out and a Chux or similar over the opening and the steamer basket placed on top to reduce splatter.",
    "NOTE that I placed silicon mats under the feet of the TMX to prevent it moving on the bench. Another alternative if you are not watching all the time is to place the whole machine into an empty kitchen sink to prevent it wandering off the bench.",
    "Once cooked allow it to cool slightly (about 5 minutes) and pour into a tray greased with olive oil. Allow the tray to cool before covering and storing in the fridge.",
    "Once set, it can be cut into pieces and wrapped in baking or greaseproof paper and then plastic wrap or foil."
