    "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Add greens a handful at a time, letting wilt slightly before adding more. Pour in ½ cup water and cook, tossing occasionally, until greens are tender, 6–8 minutes. Add lime juice; season with salt. Transfer to a plate; let cool.",
    "Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-high and mound 2 Tbsp. cheese directly on to skillet. Top with a tortilla and cook, pressing with a spatula, until cheese is melted, browned, and crisp, about 1 minute. Place, cheese side up, on a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cheese and tortillas to make 7 more quesadillas.",
    "Top each quesadilla with 2 Tbsp. greens mixture; fold in half and, working in batches, cook, turning halfway through, until greens are warmed through and tortillas are toasted, about 4 minutes.",
    "Serve quesadillas with Grilled Salsa Roja and Avocado-Tomatillo Salsa Verde alongside."
