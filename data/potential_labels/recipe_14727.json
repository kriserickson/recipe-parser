    "Prebake the pie crust in a 350F (180C) oven until light golden brown. Remove the crust from the oven but leave the oven on. Beat the egg yolks slightly and beat in the condensed milk and the lime juice. Pour into the warm pie crust and bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until the filling is slightly firm. Meanwhile, beat the egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar until foamy. Whisk in the sugar and continue whisking until the mixture is shiny and stiff peaks form. Cover the pie with the meringue, making sure the meringue touches the crust all around the edges. Bake until the meringue is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack and refrigerate. Serve chilled. Makes 1 pie to serve 6 to 8."
