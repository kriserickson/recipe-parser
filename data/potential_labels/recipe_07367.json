    "Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Set aside.",
    "In the bowl of a food processor, add the coconut flour, eggs, dates, honey, almonds, and walnuts. Pulse until nuts are chopped into smallish pieces (not completely pulverized) and the mixture forms a paste.",
    "Add in the hemp seeds, sunflower seeds, salt, vanilla, ginger, and cocoa powder. Pulse until even combined and mixture is a thick paste/dough.",
    "Using a large cookie scoop (approximately 3 Tbsp capacity), scoop mixture onto prepared baking sheet, 2\" apart. With barely damp fingers, press each cookie down to flatten about 1/2\" thick and 2.5\" diameter. If your fingers are too wet, you'll get flat, glossy cookie tops. Barely damp will let your fingers stick to the dough a little bit and give you pretty, crispy tops",
    "Bake in the preheated oven for 13 minutes, or until the center is not mushy-soft when pressed. Let cool on cookie sheet for 2 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Let sit out for at least 6 hours (more in humid climates) to dry out. If you don't, they will get really sticky when stored.",
    "Store in an non-airtight container in a cool location for up to 2 weeks. Airtight containers will seal in moisture and make the cookies sticky."
