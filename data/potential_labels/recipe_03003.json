    "Remove beef from refrigerator, uncover, and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
    "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.",
    "Place meat on preheated grill and brush with garlic-vinegar mixture. Cook meat for 4 minutes, flip, and baste. Repeat the flip and baste process every 4 minutes until beef starts to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 25 to 30 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing."
