    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, rice vinegar, sesame oil, cayenne pepper, and salt. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl or deep dish. Add the wings to the mixture and turn to coat. Cover the dish and marinate the wings at room temperature for 10 minutes.",
    "Arrange the wings in a single layer on a baking sheet, reserving the remaining marinade in the bowl. Roast the wings for 25 to 30 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade about halfway through (the 15 minutes of roasting at the end will cook any of the raw juices left in the marinade). Roast until the wings are golden brown and crispy on top. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle sesame seeds and chopped scallions on top."
