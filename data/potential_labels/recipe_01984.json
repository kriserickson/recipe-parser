    "Add all the marinade ingredients to a heavy duty zip-top plastic bag. Close bag and shake very well to combine. Add steak to bag and let marinate at least four hours, and preferably overnight.",
    "Preheat oven broiler. Drain steak, reserving marinade, and place on a rack fitted inside a rimmed baking sheet. Cook steak under broiler 5 to 7 minutes, until nicely browned on top. Turn and cook an additional 5 to 7 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, pour marinade into a small pot and bring to a boil. Cook for two minutes at a vigorous boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for five more minutesâ€”juices will reduce a bit. Let steak rest at least two minutes before slicing. Arrange on a platter, pour over reduced juices and scatter sliced scallions over top to serve."
