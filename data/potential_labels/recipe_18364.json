    "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Halve the aubergines lengthways and score the skin with a knife. Place the aubergine, garlic cloves and lemon pieces on a baking tray. Sprinkle with salt and sugar and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 50–55 minutes.",
    "Remove the aubergines from the tray and leave to cool for 20 minutes. Scrape the aubergine flesh and place directly into a blender. Squeeze the garlic pulp out of its skin by pressing on the cloves with a spoon. Place in the blender. Scrape the pulp from the lemon directly over the blender, so you don't lose any juice. Add 600ml water and process until smooth. Add the olive oil and cream, and process again.",
    "Progressively add the anchovy fillets, blending after each addition, until the taste is to your liking. This soup doesn't need to be chilled; it is nice served at room temperature. By the time you've made it, it will be ready to serve. Adjust the seasoning and serve with radishes."
