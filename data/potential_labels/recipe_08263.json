When hot, brush with a tablespoon of canola oil and add the steak. Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until steak registers 125Â°F on an instant read thermometer, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a large plate and set aside to rest.",
    "Add mushroom caps and cook until lightly browned on both sides and tender, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Season with salt and set aside. Brush pan with another tablespoon of canola oil if necessary. Add bok choy leaves and cook until leaves wilt and stems brown and become tender, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Turn off heat an set aside. Season bok choy with salt",
    "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic, ginger, and scallions and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add black bean sauce, rice wine, and chicken broth and stir until combined. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes.",
    "Add noodles to the boiling water and cook according directions on the packaging. Drain in a colander and then divide the noodles between four large bowls. Spoon over a couple tablespoons of the sauce. Cut the flank steak against the grain into 1/2-inch thick slices. Divide the steak slices, mushrooms, and bok choy between the four bowls. Drizzle on more of the sauce and some chili oil (optional). Serve immediately."
