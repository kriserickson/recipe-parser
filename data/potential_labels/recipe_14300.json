    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the soba noodles and cook until the noodles are cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Strain through a medium mesh sieve and rinse the noodles under cold running water for 1 minute.",
    "Meanwhile, make the broth. Bring the chicken broth, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 3 minutes, then add the mushrooms and simmer until they’re tender, about 5 minutes. Add 3/4 of the scallions and simmer until soft, about 1 minute.",
    "Divide the noodles among 4 bowls and pour the soup over the noodles. Add the spinach or greens, sprinkle with the remaining scallions and serve each bowl with a hard boiled egg half. Kampai!"
