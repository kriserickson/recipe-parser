    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment (not foil – they stick to foil) and lightly spray with olive oil cooking spray.",
    "Place the broccoli in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover with a microwave-safe plate and microwave 5 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking, to thaw. Drain well.",
    "Meanwhile, in another large bowl, whisk together the eggs, salt, garlic powder, oregano, black pepper and cayenne. Add the cheddar and the almond flour, then add the thawed and drained broccoli. Use a large spoon to mix everything together.",
    "Use your hands to form the mixture into 24 patties. Arrange the patties on the prepared baking sheets, making sure they don’t touch each other. Lightly spray the tots with olive oil.",
    "Bake 15 minutes on each side, until browned. Allow the broccoli tots to cool a couple of minutes, then serve."
