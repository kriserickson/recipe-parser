    "Fill a casserole dish with an inch of water. Slice Acorn Squash in half (horizontal slice as shown) and lay flat in dish. Place in oven to roast at 350 degrees for 60-75 minutes.",
    "When your squash is roasted the skin should peel away quite easily. Remove all skin and place squash flesh in a food processor. Add all other ingredients.",
    "Blend on high for at least 2 minutes. You want all the parsley to chop into fine bits. Set sauce aside.",
    "Boil a pot of salted water. Cook your pasta. 2-3 minutes before the pasta is ready to drain, add mushrooms and optional protein add-in's. Drain as usual. Toss dry pasta in a splash of EVOO (opt'l).",
    "QuickStep Note: I cook my mushrooms/tempeh and sausage simply by throwing them into my pasta pot 2-3 minutes before draining my pasta. This allows me to boil my protein/veggies quickly without adding in another step. I drain pasta/veggies/protein together.",
    "6. Toss warm pasta in your Acorn Alfredo Sauce. Mix well so each pasta bit is coated.",
    "7. You can either store in fridge and re-heat later - or eat right away - or transfer pasta into an oven safe dish and let heat at 300 degrees for 20 minutes. This will marinate the pasta a bit and soften the sauce. You can even add a sprinkle of Daiya cheese on top if you'd like."
