    "Place the eggplant in a large bowl and rub with olive oil, za'atar seasoning and oregano until well coated.",
    "You can either roast or use the skillet to cook, both work! If you are doubling the recipe, then I recommend roasting.",
    "To roast: Place the eggplant in a baking dish and roast at 400 degrees for 30 minutes until very soft.",
    "To saute: heat a bit more oil in a large cast iron skillet (or other non-stick skillet) over medium heat. Add eggplant and cook for 10-15 minutes until very tender.",
    "Combine the very thinly sliced onion and vinegar in a bowl. Let sit while you cook the eggplant and make the hummus sauce. Drain before serving.",
    "Combine the ingredients for the sauce: hummus, lemon juice, garlic, dill and a pinch salt/pepper. Set aside.",
    "Make the gyros: pile the onions, cucumber, tomato, cucumber and cooked eggplant on the flatbreads. Drizzle with hummus sauce and eat immediately."
