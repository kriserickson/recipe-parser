    "Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 400째F (200째C). Combine butter, coconut oil, sugar, salt, baking powder, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix at low speed to combine gently, then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes, pausing to scrape the bowl with a flexible spatula halfway through. With the mixer running, add egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix to form a stiff dough. Divide into twenty-four 1 1/4-ounce (2-tablespoon; 30-ml) portions.",
    "For the Cinnamon Sugar: Mix sugar with ground and grated cinnamon in a small bowl, adding more spice if you prefer. (It should taste very intense to offset the mild dough.) Roll each portion of dough into a smooth and sticky ball, then tumble in cinnamon sugar until fully coated. Arrange on a parchment-lined aluminum baking sheet, leaving 2 1/2 inches between balls, then flatten into 2-inch disks about 1/2 inch thick. Generously cover with the remaining cinnamon sugar, creating a thick layer that will crack and crinkle in the oven.",
    "Bake until the snickerdoodles begin to spread, about 5 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350째F (175째C). Continue baking until firm around the edges but steamy in the middle, about 6 minutes longer. Cool directly on baking sheet until the crumb is set, about 8 minutes. Enjoy warm, or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days at room temperature."
