    "Cut the bagel hole to be about 1 1/2 inches wide. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the bottom half of the bagel, cut side down and cook until toasted. Remove from the skillet and spread with cream cheese. Return to the skillet and sprinkle the cheddar over the cream cheese. Add the top half to the skillet, cut side facing down. Crack an egg into each hole (both bottom and top half) and cook 1 minute. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake 8-10 minutes or until the eggs are just set. Repeat with the remaining bagel or just make 2 at once.",
    "To assemble, add the bacon, avocado and a handful of greens to each bagel. Add the top bagel and season the eggs with salt and pepper. Eat!"
