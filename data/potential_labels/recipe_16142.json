    "For BBQ tofu: Sprinkle tofu with salt and pepper. Mix bbq sauce and 1-2 teaspoons sriacha together in a small bowl. Taste, adjust heat. If you like crispy tofu, stir in a couple teaspoons of olive oil. Liberally coat the top and sides of the tofu with the bbq sauce.",
    "For the Mexican Tofu: Stir all ingredients together in a small bowl then brush the marinade on the tofu.",
