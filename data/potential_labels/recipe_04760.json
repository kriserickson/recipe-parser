Frost the cake with the pudding mixture. These instructions will make a single layered amazing cake that is delicous!",
    "PLEASE NOTE: To get the layered look as in this particular picture - make your cakes in well greased and floured pans - follow baking instructions. I then tip then out onto cooling rack and invert back onto a cookie sheet. Proceed to poke holes and do the jello thing and refrigerate."
