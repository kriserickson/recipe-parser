    "Process:",
    "1. Blend spice paste ingredients into a fine paste.",
    "2. Heat a pot of water and add lemongrass, galangal, torch ginger flower. Bring to a boil and then add fish. Boil on medium heat for 15-20 minutes or until the fish is cooked.",
    "3. Transfer cooked fish to a bowl and let cool. Strain broth to remove spices. Add to the broth the Vietnamese mint, tamarind juice and tamarind peel and continue to boil on low heat.",
    "4. Break the fish meat into tiny pieces, but keep some in bigger chunks.",
    "5. Add the fish flakes back into the pot, along with the spice paste.",
    "6. When it reaches a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 40 minutes to one hour. While simmering, add salt and sugar to balance the spiciness and sourness for your taste.",
    "7. Rinse laksa noodles in cold water and strain. Place one serving of noodles into a bowl, and pour laksa soup with fish flakes over the top.",
    "8. Top with garnishing, and serve with a spoonful of shrimp paste if you like.",
    "Enjoy the five tastes – sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami – of Penang Asam Laksa!",
    "Notes:",
    "1. If you prefer your asam laksa soup to be less sour, cut down on the tamarind peel or tamarind pulp. If you like it to be spicy, add more chili to your spice paste. For a more pungent flavour, use more shrimp paste (belacan and heh koh).",
    "2. Hawker stalls tend to use low quality local mackerel (ikan kembong) in asam laksa. When making the dish at home, you can use a better quality fish like horse mackerel (ikan selar kuning), fresh sardine, or yellowtail kingfish (ikan pelata)."
