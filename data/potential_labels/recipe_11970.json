    "Method",
    "Chop the chocolate into small pieces, then place into a bowl with the coconut oil. Heat the coconut milk in a small pan over a low heat, then pour into the bowl and stir gently to combine – it’s important not to mix too quickly.",
    "Stir in the vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract. Cover the bowl with cling film, then place in the fridge to set for at least 4 hours.",
    "When the truffle mixture has almost set, toast the desiccated coconut over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly golden. Tip onto a plate, then return the pan to a medium heat and add the nuts. Toast for around 2 minutes, or until golden, then leave to cool for a few minutes. Finely chop, then place onto a second plate. Spread out the cocoa powder onto a third plate.",
    "Using a teaspoon, scoop out little balls of the truffle mixture and roll in the palm of your hands, placing them onto a tray as you go. It’s totally up to you how you decorate them – roll the balls in either the toasted coconut or chopped nuts, or for a simple finish, roll them in the cocoa powder. Return the decorated truffles to the fridge for around 10 minutes to firm up, then serve."
