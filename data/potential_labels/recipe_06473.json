    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Combine all dry ingredients except for the whole oats. You'll notice that I specified 'ground oats' instead of 'oat flour.' I found that processing the oats myself until they were thoroughly ground but still slightly coarse produced the best results in terms of texture.",
    "In a separate bowl, combine all wet ingredients except for rehydrated cherries.",
    "Fold wet mixture into dry mixture.",
    "Add roughly 3/4 of the oats and mix to combine, and then add cherries. For added flavor, experiment with rehydrating the cherries in liquids besides water, like orange or cranberry juice, or even brandy. I rehydrated my cherries in a warm infusion of ginger and lemon.",
    "Once mixed, allow to sit for 5 minutes. Then add remaining oats.",
    "Form dough into roughly tablespoon size balls, space them two inches apart on a lined baking pan, and flatten to approximately 1/2\". While both worked well, I found better results with parchment paper over silicone mats.",
    "Sprinkle with sea salt and lightly tap salt crystals into the dough.",
    "Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden brown. After removing cookies from oven, wait for 5-10 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack to cool for an additional 15-20 minutes.",
    "Makes 14-18 cookies."
