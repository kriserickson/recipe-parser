    "In a large mixing bowl toss potatoes with remaining olive oil. Add parmesan, rosemary and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste (about 1/2 tsp each), then toss to evenly distribute.",

    "Pour mixture onto prepared baking sheet and spread into an even layer (add parmesan clumps that may have fallen off potatoes back on tops of potatoes).",

    "Bake in preheated oven until golden brown on bottom, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, add garlic and toss (they may stick slightly so use a thin melt a spatula to lift from pan and rotate).",

    "I like to use refrigerated grated parmesan. Shelf stable works too, such as Kraft I just prefer the fresher taste of the refrigerated kind. And I’ve found I don’t like shredded parmesan here because it doesn’t coat as evenly. For best results go with the powdery stuff.",
    "8",
    "If you don’t have fresh herbs on hand I’ve also made these with Italian seasoning instead, use 1 1/2 tsp (instead of rosemary and parsley).",
    "9",
    "Wait to add the garlic until that 30 minute point so it doesn’t burn. Otherwise you’ll end with bitter garlic.",
    "10",
    "Use a flat metal spatula to turn the potatoes. Even when the baking sheet is greased and dusted with flour you’ll likely find a few still sticking, so that thin spatula will help turn them (if you try non-stick foil let me know how that works).",
    "11",
    "If you find they don’t brown enough to your liking try using a darker baking sheet the next time around. The dark coating on those promotes browning."
