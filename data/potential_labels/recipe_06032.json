    "Grind the flax seed and mix with the 5 tbsp warm water and set aside. Grind the buckwheat flour and I usually throw the chia seeds in as well so I don’t have whole seeds in my muffins. Put all the dry ingredients in a bowl along with the cinnamon. Separately, mash the banana and add the vanilla, melted coconut oil, maple syrup and almond milk. Add to the dry ingredients and mix well, then add in the blueberries and mix until combined. Divide between 6 greased muffin tin cups. If you do want to line them with paper liners make sure they’re well greased as they stick. Bake for 28-32 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean. Serve warm."
