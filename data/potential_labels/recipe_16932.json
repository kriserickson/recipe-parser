    "RECIPE PREPARATION",
    "Carefully lift the turkey roasting pan and strain drippings into a small bowl or measuring cup; discard solids. Skim fat from surface, reserving ¼ cup. Add drippings to stock.",
    "Set roasting pan over 2 burners set to medium-high heat. Add wine and cook, scraping up any brown bits, until almost evaporated, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and whisk in flour and reserved fat. Cook, whisking, until roux is deep golden brown, about 5 minutes.",
    "Whisking, gradually ladle stock mixture into roux and simmer (still whisking!) until thickened; add vinegar. Strain into a medium saucepan if you prefer a smooth texture. Stir in soy sauce and/or herbs, if using; season with salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve."
