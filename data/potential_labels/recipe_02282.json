    "Sprinkle yeast over the warm water and let it sit for a few minutes. Once the yeast begins to foam, you can add the sugar, garlic powder, melted butter, oil and salt. Mix together then gradually add the flour, mixing in your stand mixer with a dough hook or by hand. Knead for 10 minutes then place is an oiled bowl and cover with a soft cloth.",
    "Let the dough rise for about 30 minutes, or until dough doubles in size.",
    "Preheat the oven to 375 F. Line insulated baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Divide the dough into about 18 equal pieces. Put about a 3/4-inch chunk of cheese in each one and make sure you pinch all the edges back up tightly. Put the pinched side down on baking sheet. Cut small slices from remaining cheese and place on top of buns.",
    "Bake for about 11-15 minutes until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Brush with the melted butter and serve warm."
