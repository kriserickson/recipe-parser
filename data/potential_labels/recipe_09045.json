    "In a large pot, combine the cauliflower, carrot, celery, onion, water and bouillon. Bring mixture to a boil then reduce heat; Cover and simmer for 12-15 minutes or until vegetables are tender (do not drain). The liquid will barely cover the veggies.",
    "In another large saucepan, melt the butter for the roux. Stir in the flour, salt and pepper until smooth. Whisk the milk in slowly. Bring to a boil over medium heat; Cook and stir the mixture for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat. Stir in the cheese until melted. Add hot pepper sauce if desired. Stir into the cauliflower mixture until combined.",
    "Puree about 2½ cups of the soup in the blender and pour back into the soup. This makes the soup extra creamy."
