    "In a small saucepan set over low heat, combine coconut oil, almond milk, coconut sugar, and salt. Heat until coconut oil has melted, stirring until until sugar has dissolved and mixture is completely smooth.",
    "Remove saucepan from heat. Add vanilla and stir until combined. Add both flours and mix until fully incorporated. Dough should be moist and stick together when pressed. If it is too dry and crumbly, add a splash of almond milk. If it is too sticky, add a sprinkle of flour.",
    "Divide dough into 8 equal parts and roll each part between your palms to form balls. Set the balls onto a parchment lined baking sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes until dough has set.",
    "When balls have set, prepare the coating by melting your chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring periodically to ensure no clumps remain.",
    "Using a toothpick, dip each ball into melted white chocolate, gently tapping side of bowl to remove any excess. Place back onto parchment-lined baking sheet and immediately top with coconut, sprinkles, or crushed candy canes. Repeat until all truffles have been coated.",
    "Refrigerate for 15 minutes, or until the chocolate has set. Store truffles in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks, or freeze for up to 1 month."
