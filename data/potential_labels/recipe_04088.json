    "First, clean the sprouts. Trim the cut ends back without interferring with the leaves, and peel any withered leaves off the bulb. Score the bottoms; one cut will suffice.",
    "Then place the sprouts in boiling, salted water for no more than five minutes. NO MORE!",
    "Drain, drizzle with oil and toss in a bowl with the salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and celery salt.",
    "When the sprouts are nice and coated, place on a hot grill (but keep the bowl handy), turning every four minutes for a total of twelve minutes.",
    "Remove from the grill back to the seasoning bowl and toss to coat with any remaining seasoning.",
    "If desired, add any or all of the remaining three ingredients (bacon, lemon zest, parmesan cheese)"
