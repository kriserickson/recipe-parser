    "Form the salmon into 3 ounce balls. I usually end up with about 10.",
    "Put the almond flour in a plate. Carefully flatten each salmon patty in the palm of your hand and then dip into the almond flour. They are fragile so I like to place the patty into the flour and then scoop some of the flour on top of the salmon, and then lightly tap it down with my fingers.",
    "Preheat a skillet with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Fry the patties over medium-high heat for a few minutes on each side. They should be cooked through and browned when finished.",
    "Serve two patties with some of our homemade tartar sauce, and veggies."
