    "Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic cloves and cook for another minute. Add the broccoli and cook for about 4 minutes, until the broccoli is bright green in color. Add the cumin, salt and pepper. Stir to combine.",
    "Add the water or chicken stock, lower the heat and cover. Cook for about 8 minutes, until the broccoli has been softened. and is just tender.",
    "Here’s the tricky part. We’re going to blend the soup. Working in batches, transfer some of the soup liquid and broccoli to a blender. Add half of the arugula leaves and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl or another pot while you blend the second batch of soup with the rest of the arugula. Return to a pot over a low flame, check to see if it needs more salt or pepper. Throw in the juice of 1/2 a lemon and serve.",
    "This soup also freezes well!"
