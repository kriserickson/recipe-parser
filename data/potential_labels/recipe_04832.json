    "Put all the ingredients in a blender or a dosa grinder and blend with enough water till you have a runny and smooth batter. The batter should be runnier than a pancake batter, but thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.",
    "Heat a cast-iron or non-stick griddle.",
    "Using a rounded ladle, pour about 1/4 cup of the dosa batter in the center of the griddle. Quickly, using the rounded bottom of the ladle, start spreading the batter outward from the center in a spiralling design, until you have a dosa about 6-7 inches in diameter.",
    "You can pour a few drops of oil around the dosaâ€™s edge to make it crispier, or just spray with some non-stick cooking spray.",
    "When the underside is golden-brown, flip over and cook another minute or two.",
    "Serve hot with chutney."
