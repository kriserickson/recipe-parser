    "Filling Instructions:",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees",
    "Bring 1 cup whey to boil in medium saucepan",
    "In separate bowl, whisk sugar, arrowroot powder, and remaining 1/2 cup cold whey until it forms a smooth paste",
    "Add paste mixture into the hot whey, stirring constantly until it thickens",
    "In another small bowl, lightly beat egg yolks and combine with butter, salt, and lemon juice",
    "Temper by pouring a small amount of the hot mixture into egg yolk mixture and stirring, to ensure you don't end up with bits of scrambled eggs",
    "Add tempered mixture back into saucepan, cook entire concoction an additional two minutes, stirring constantly",
    "Pour filling into prebaked pie shell",
    "Set aside and prepare meringue",
    "Prepare Meringue:",
    "Use electric mixer to beat egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, and vanilla extract in a bowl until entire mixture is foamy, but not yet starting to thicken",
    "Begin to add sugar, one tablespoon at a time",
    "Beat thoroughly after each addition",
    "Dissolve sugar completely to prevent \"weeping\" droplets from forming on your meringue",
    "Once all sugar is added, continue to beat mixture at medium-high speed until it forms stiff, sharp peaks when you lift mixer from bowl",
    "Place large spoonfuls of meringue around the edges of pie and use back of spoon to gently \"seal\" it to crust to help keep it from shrinking",
    "Once you have a ring of meringue around the outside, dump remaining meringue in a mound in center and smooth out evenly",
    "Use back of spoon to make little spikes like you see in my photos",
    "Carefully place pie in preheated oven and bake at 350 degrees 12-15 minutes",
    "Allow to cool on counter before serving"
