    "1. Make a batch of raw alfredo sauce.",
    "2. Spiralize your zucchini.",
    "3. Chop your \"primavera\" vegetables by hand. You can use any vegetables that you like. But remember that simpler actually tastes better, so don't add too many types of chopped veggies. Try to use 3 types of chopped veggies max. Ideas: button mushroom, tomatoes, red onion, green pepper, broccoli, chopped cilantro, etc.",
    "4. Sprinkle with a bit of pepper once done."
