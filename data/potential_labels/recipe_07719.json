    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Blend together flour, seasoned salt, cayenne pepper and ground black pepper. Cut wings and dredge them in the flour. Heat oil to 350 degrees. Fry wings for about 5 to 7 minutes, and then drain on a wire rack. Depending upon the side of your pot fry 5 or 6 wings at a time. Be sure to stir the wings once during cooking to make sure that the wings cook evening. Cook the wings until they just begin to brown. Bake wings for about 15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.",
    "Prepare the sauce by melting the butter and the garlic powder in a small pan. When the wings have finished cooking in the oven place the wings into a large bowl. Stir in half of the Parmesan cheese into the melted butter. Pour the melted garlic butter over the wings and toss until the wings are well coated. Serve the wings by sprinkling the remaining Parmesan cheese top of the wings."
