    "In a large bowl, cream together the cream cheese, margarita mix, and condensed milk with a handheld electric mixer on medium speed until combined. Continue beating for about 2 minutes or until creamy and smooth.",
    "Spoon in the Cool Whip and lime zest and beat to combine. Continue beating for about 2-3 minutes or until mixture is thick and fluffy. Mixture will continue to thicken as you whip it.",
    "Pour the mixture into the prepared crust and smooth out the top. Immediately freeze for up to 4-6 hours or overnight (overnight recommended) before cutting into slices. Garnish with the sparkling sugar right before serving. This is best served straight from the freezer or slightly thawed."
