    "If your dates are not sticky and moist, soak in warm water for 10 minutes and then drain. Otherwise, proceed to step 2.",
    "Add dates to a food processor and pulse until only small bits remain - it will likely clump into a ball - thatâ€™s what you want. If any big pieces remain, use a knife or spatula to push them down, then turn the machine back on to pulse.",
    "Add peanut butter and oats and pulse a few more times until incorporated, stirring and scraping down sides as needed. If you prefer denser bars, add more oats.",
    "Transfer to a parchment-lined 8x8 dish and press down until flat, OR scoop out 1 Tbsp amounts and roll into a ball and place on a baking sheet or plate. Transfer to freezer to set.",
    "If making bars, slice into 8-10 bars and store in the fridge or freezer to keep fresh. They can be a little flimsy at room temp, so be gentle with how you stack them.",
    "Will keep in the fridge for several weeks, and in the freezer for up to a couple months or more."
