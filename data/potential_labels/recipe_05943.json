    "Combine chicken with dry ingredients, allow to marinate for one to four hours, if you have the time, in the fridge. Grind with using the small plate into a chilled bowl. Using a really big wooden spoon stir this mixture and add no more than 125 ml (1/2 cup) or milk or water. Continue stirring until it starts to come together, about 1 minute. Stuff into hog casings, twist into links. Allow sausages to rest, uncovered, in the refrigerator, if you have time. If not, go ahead and grill over indirect heat until done.",
    "Yield: About 8 - 6 inch sausages."
