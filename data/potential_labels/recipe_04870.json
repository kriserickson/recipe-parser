    "1 For the Crust: In a food processor, pulse Oreos until finely ground. Add melted butter and pulse for another few seconds until evenly coated. Alternatively, put the cookies in a zipper-lock bag and crush with a rolling pin before adding the melted butter. Spoon Oreo mixture into 4 to 6 serving glasses in an even layer. Set aside.",
    "2 For the Nutella Filling: In a small bowl, whip cream with sugar until it holds soft peaks. Set aside. In a medium-sized mixing bowl and using an electric hand mixer, whip cream cheese until smooth and fluffy. Add Nutella and whip until smooth, about 2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold in whipped cream until no streaks remain.",
    "3 For the Chocolate Filling: Melt chocolate in the bowl of a double boiler or in the microwave. Set aside to cool slightly.",
    "4 In a small bowl, whip cream with sugar until it holds soft peaks. Set aside. In a medium-sized mixing bowl and using an electric hand mixer, whip cream cheese until smooth and fluffy. Add cooled chocolate and cocoa powder and beat until smooth, about 2 minutes. Mix in two thirds of the whipped cream. If the mixture looks lumpy after 3 minutes of mixing, pass through a fine-meshed sieve. Fold in the remaining whipped cream with a rubber spatula.",
    "5 For Serving: Spoon or pipe filling into serving cups, starting with layers of Chocolate Filling followed by Nutella Filling. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. Garnish with whipped cream, crushed Oreoâ€™s or toasted hazelnuts before serving."
