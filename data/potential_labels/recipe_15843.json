    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees and spray a muffin tin with cooking oil.",
    "In a large bowl toss the shredded sweet potatoes with the olive oil, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper.",
    "Use your fingers to press approximately 1/3 cup of the shredded sweet potatoes into the bottom and sides of each muffin cup creating a nest.",
    "Bake until the potatoes are golden brown, about 18-25 minutes, keep on eye on them so the tips of the potato shreds donâ€™t burn.",
    "Remove the potatoes from the oven and crack an egg into each nest, topping with salt and pepper.",
    "Place them back in the oven to bake for another 10-15 minutes depending on how well done you like your eggs cooked.",
    "Remove from the oven and let them cool for a couple minutes before serving topped with hot sauce, cilantro and avocado."
