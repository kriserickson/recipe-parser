    "Whisk flour, garlic powder, baking powder and salt together in a bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the yogurt, oil and milk.",
    "Knead for about 1 minute until a soft dough is formed (it doesn't need long). Cover bowl with wrap or a plate and set aside to rest at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.",
    "Dust a clean work bench with a light coating of flour. Divide dough in half, then divide each half in 4 equal-sized pieces (you will have 8 pieces in total). Roll the pieces into balls; flatten them out with the palms of your hands, then use a rolling pin to roll each piece 2mm thick and about 3 1/2 inches or 10cm in diameter.",
    "Lightly grease a nonstick pan with cooking oil spray (or a small brush of oil) over medium heat. Cook one piece for 2 minutes on one side. Lightly spray or brush the top over with oil/butter again before flipping. Cook until golden. Repeat with remaining flatbread.",
    "To serve, lightly brush each piece with a small amount of olive oil or garlic olive oil (optional)."
