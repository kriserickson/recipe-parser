    "We all love them cookies! I know I do. But I always try to avoid them because I know how unhealthy they are. But not always. Here is a recipe for healthy cookies, and I don’t mean using artificial sweeteners. These chocolate avocado cookies, have the avocado replacing the butter. These cookies are organic and not all that bad for you! Avocados are rich and soft, therefore, they make a great substitute for unhealthy butter. You can’t taste the avocado, so don’t freak out.",
