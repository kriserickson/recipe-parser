    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.",
    "Place the zucchini, yellow squash and corn in a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt + pepper.",
    "Meanwhile, cover all the phyllo dough with a lightly dampened clean kitchen towel to prevent it from drying out as you work. Then place 2 sheets of phyllo on the prepared sheet pan and brush with a little butter. Place another 2 sheets of phyllo on top of the buttered sheet, rotated a half-turn in the opposite direction, so that the edges hang over the long side of the first sheet (you are trying to create a circle). Brush with butter, and repeat with the remaining sheets of phyllo, alternating the direction of the phyllo as you place over the last sheet. Now carefully bring up the sides of the dough to create a \"crust\". Lightly brush the crust with butter...now you have a phyllo crust!",
    "Sprinkle the fresh herbs over the curst. Add the provolone. Now grab the squash and corn and use your hands to drain any water that has been released from the squash back into the bowl. Scatter the squash and corn over the pizza in an even layer.",
    "Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the crust golden. Remove from the oven and top with torn burratta, crushed red pepper, basil and a drizzle of truffle oil. Enjoy!"
