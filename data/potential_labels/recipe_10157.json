    "Wrap all the potatoes in aluminum foil and bake for about an hour until fork tender and let them cool completely. You can roast the garlic at the same time using the same method but take the garlic out of the oven after a half hour.",
    "Poach the salmon in gently boiling salted water for about 10 minutes. Cool completely, remove bones and skin and break into bite sized pieces.",
    "Remove the cooled sweet potatoes and russet potatoes from their skins and mash them together. Mash the roasted garlic cloves with a fork before adding them to the mashed sweet and russet potatoes. Add the beaten egg and stir well. Fold in the tarragon and salmon gently. You don’t want to break up the salmon too much as you blend it into the mashed potatoes. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Form the mashed potato and salmon mixture into balls about the size of a small orange. Roll the balls in Panko crumbs and pat them into 1 inch thick cakes and fry in canola oil over medium low heat until golden brown. Serve with a squeeze of lime."
