    "To make the Gnudi:",
    "In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1/3 cup parmesan, chopped spinach, egg, flour, salt, pepper and nutmeg together just until it’s combined.",
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a teaspoon of salt to the water for added flavor.",
    "In another shallow bowl, add another cup to cup and a half of flour. Take a heaping spoonful of the ricotta mixture, shape it into an egg and roll it in the flour. Set on a cutting board until ready to cook. Repeat with the rest of the ricotta mixture until it’s all used up.",
    "If the gnudi dumplings start to get a little sticky, simply roll them a second time in the flour before dropping in the hot water.",
    "Drop two or three gnudi into the boiling water and cook for about two to three minutes. You only want the outside to slightly firm up. The inside will still be a little creamy, but will finish cooking in the oven without getting tough.",
    "Transfer the partially cooked gnudi to a baking dish, lightly greased with olive oil. Pour the béchamel sauce over top. Sprinkle the gnudi with the remaining 1/3 cup of parmesan and bake on 375 for about 20-25 minutes until the cheese on top begins to brown.",
    "To make the béchamel:",
    "In a small stock pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour, stirring to combine with the butter and allow it to cook for about 5 minutes until it turns a light golden color.",
    "While the flour and butter are cooking, heat up the milk in a separate pot. When it gets hot, but not quite boiling, pour half into the butter and flour mixture, whisking to keep the mixture smooth. Add in the remaining half of milk, nutmeg, salt and pepper, and continue to cook until the sauce thickens and is smooth. About 7-10 minutes."
