    "First we must turn a butternut squash into a puree. Peel and cut the squash into chunks. Then steam or cook the chunks till soft. Put them in a blender or food processor and blend until you end up with a smooth puree. Set 1 cup aside for this recipe, use the rest for other recipes (for ideas see blogpost).",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit/175 degrees Celsius.",
    "Put all ingredients in a food processor and process into a smooth batter. When you're a real sweet tooth you might want to use more sugar in this recipe. 1/3 to 1/2 cup instead of the quarter cup I used.",
    "Butter a brownie tin (9x9 inch/23x23 cm).",
    "Pour batter into tin and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit/175 degrees Celsius for 25 minutes.",
    "Cut into 16 squares and enjoy!"
