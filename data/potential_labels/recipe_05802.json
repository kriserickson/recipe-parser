    "Toss sliced okra gently with oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Move okra onto a rimmed baking sheet and bake for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Turn okra to the other side halfway through the cooking time. Total time to cook the okra depends on the thickness of the slice, so adjust baking time accordingly. Remove from oven when crispy and transfer to a paper towel. Any leftovers can be refrigerated. They will lose their crispiness but may be reheated.",

    "Grilled Okra Variation: Slice okra or leave whole. Toss gently with oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Preheat a grill pan on the stove, or preheat the grill to medium. Add the okra to the hot pan or grill and cook 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove when crispy."
