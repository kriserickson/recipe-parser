Place two or three of spoonfuls of the beetroot & goat cheese filling in the middle of the bread (not all the way to the sides), place the salad leaf on top, so it’ll cover the spread. Place a couple of spoonfuls of White Quinoa & Raisins and a couple of spoonfuls of Orange & Green Lentils on top.",
    "Here is how you fold them together.",
    "Fold each side in, about 1 inch, then fold the end closest to you over the filling and ‘tuck it in’. Fold each side a little, one more time, so you kind of lock the filling. And finally roll the wrap over in the same direction one more time. Roll some wrapping paper around them and tie a string around them to hold them together. Done! When serving, cut them in halves."
