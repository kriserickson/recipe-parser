    "Place the hominy and tepary beans in separate medium bowls. Add enough water to each to cover the beans by 4 inches, and soak overnight at room temperature.",
    "About 3 hours before serving, drain the hominy and the beans and place them in separate 3- to 4-quart pots. Add enough cool water to cover the hominy and tepary beans by 4 inches. Set each over high heat, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally and skimming any foam that rises to the surface, until tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Reserve 2/3 cup of the cooking liquid from each type of beans (for 1 1/3 cups liquid). Drain the hominy and the beans and set aside.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the squash: Heat the oven to 425 degrees. On a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, toss the squash with 1 tablespoon oil and a pinch of coarse sea salt. Arrange the squash in an even layer and roast until golden and very tender, stirring halfway through, 35 to 45 minutes.",
    "In a large skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Add the onion, chile powder, sage and a generous pinch of smoked salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the reserved 1 1/3 cups cooking liquid and bring to a simmer.",
    "Add the cooked hominy and beans to the skillet, then stir in the roasted squash and greens. Season to taste with coarse sea salt and serve."
