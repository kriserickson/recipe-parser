    "Simply put all ingredients, turmeric first, through your juicer. Server over ice for an extra refreshing beverage. If you find the flavor or effect to be overly robust, cut it with some filtered water or coconut water. Be careful with your clothes and kitchen cloths during clean up. There is a reason it has been used as a natural dye for centuries.",
