    "Heat the oil in a heavy, shallow pot over medium-high heat. Sauté the tortilla strips about 3 minutes or until golden; remove them with a slotted spoon to a plate, and set aside. Add the seasoned chicken to the oil in the pot, sauté until nicely browned, and remove with slotted spoon to a separate plate.",

    "Add the onion to the oil in the pot. Sauté about 3 minutes, until the onion is translucent. Add the garlic and jalapeños, and sauté 1 minute more. Add the broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, beans, and chicken (with any accumulated juices). Raise the heat, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup chopped cilantro and the lime juice. Add 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste. Stir the corn and most of the tortilla strips into the hot soup. Serve topped with avocado, lime wedges, extra cilantro, and tortilla strips, with hot sauce on the side."
