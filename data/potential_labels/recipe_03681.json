    "Season chicken thighs liberally with salt and pepper.",
    "Heat a large heavy-bottomed skillet or saucepan with a lid over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons of oil. Allow oil to warm until hot, but not smoking. Add chicken and sear until it is golden-brown on all sides. Once chicken is brown, remove it to a plate and set aside.",
    "Add onion to the pan and cook until it is slightly browned. Stir in the kale a little at a time until it is wilted. Return the chicken to the pan and add the bay leaves.",
    "Meanwhile, in a bowl or measuring cup, mix together chicken stock and curry paste. Pour it over the chicken and stir to coat all elements with curry. Stir in the chickpeas, bring entire mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and allow to simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Rotate and flip chicken and cook uncovered for another 30 minutes, or until chicken is tender and chickpeas are softened.",
    "Serve warm."
