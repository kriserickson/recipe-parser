    "Melt the chocolate bain-marie style. Set aside and leave to cool. Mix the butter, sugar and eggs until smooth and then mix in the cooled chocolate and rum making sure you do not beat. Mix the chocolate mixture together with the biscuits and pistachios. Once all well combined place onto a sheet of greaseproof paper in a loaf shape and then roll to form your salame shape. Leave to chill for 2-3 hours and then slice and serve with some mascarpone or cream."
