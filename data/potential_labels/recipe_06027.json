    "Preheat your oven to 350F and line a standard muffin tin with 12 parchment cups.",
    "In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ground flax or chia seeds with the 3 tablespoons of water, and mix well. Allow to set for 5-10 minutes, until it gels together. Add in the buckwheat flour, cinnamon, salt, coconut oil, mashed bananas and water or milk, and stir until a uniform batter is formed. Add in the baking soda and vinegar, and mix quickly to distribute throughout the batter.",
    "Gently fold in the walnuts, or other add-ins, then use a ¼ cup to scoop the batter into the paper muffin liners, filling them about ¾ of the way full.",
    "Bake at 350F for about 20 minutes, until the centers are firm and the tops are starting to crack. Allow to cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer the muffins to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "These muffins can be stored at room temperature for a couple days, but for best shelf life, store them in a sealed container in the fridge."
