    "In a medium bowl, mix the water with the sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over top of the water, and let it rest for 5 minutes, to hydrate.",
    "Stir the yeast mixture. Then, add the oil, 2 cups of flour, and salt. Mix well.",
    "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, until soft and smooth, adding the last ½ cup of flour as needed.",
    "Place the dough in a clean, greased bowl and cover it with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, 1-2 hours.",
    "Once the dough has risen, punch it down and stretch it into an oval, roughly 12 x 8 inches.",
    "Place the shaped dough onto a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover the dough again and let rise for 30 minutes.",
    "Near the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 375F.",
    "Uncover the dough and gently press your fingers all over the top, creating small indents. Brush the dough with a little water and sprinkle it generously with the sesame seeds.",
    "Bake the lagana for 20-30 min, until golden brown.",
    "Allow the bread to cool on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes before serving."
