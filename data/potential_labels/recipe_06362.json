    "Step 2 Spray a large non-stick frying pan lightly with the olive oil spray and heat over medium-high heat. Add 4 rissoles and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side or until browned. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for a further 2-3 minutes on each side or until just cooked. Remove from pan, cover with foil and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining patties. Serve rissoles with the salad leaves, tomatoes and cucumber drizzled with balsamic vinegar."
