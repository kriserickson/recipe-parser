    "Cream the oil and sugar together until fully incorporated. Add the eggs one at a time and then add the orange juice and vanilla. Mix well. Mix the baking powder, flour and salt together and mix into the dough. You may need more flour so add more flour by the 1/4 cup full until it is the consistency of a cookie dough. Flour your rolling surface and taking small portions of the dough at a time roll out the dough so that it is thick enough to hold the filling but not too thick. Using the top of a glass or a round cookie cutter cut circles out of the dough. Place 1/2 tsp of desired filling in the center of each circle and then form the hamentaschen by first crimping together the top of the circle to form the peak of a triangle and then lifting up the bottom of the dough and pressing it to the sides to form a triangle. Place on a baking tray and bake at 350 for 7-10 minute or until lightly golden brown."
