    "Heat the oil in a large pan that has a lid, add in the onions and cook gently for a couple of minutes until soft and translucent. Turn up the heat and add in the chicken, cook for a couple of minutes until sealed and then stir through the ground coriander and oxo/bouillon. Cook for another minute, then add in the peanut butter, juice of one of the limes, the chopped chilli and boiling water. Give everything a stir, then put the lid on, and leave to bubble gently on a low/medium heat for 10 minutes.",
    "Add in the green beans and the remaining lime juice. Give everything a stir, and leave to cook for another 5 minutes with the lid off. You can add a splash of water if it’s starting to look too dry.",
    "Serve with rice, and sprinkle with chopped chillies (or Sweet Chilli Jam ) and coriander."
