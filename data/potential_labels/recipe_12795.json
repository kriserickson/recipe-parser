    "Poke approximately 20-25 holes, spread evenly, over the top of the cake with the bottom of a wooden spoon. Pour the sweetened condensed milk over top, trying to fill the holes as much as possible.",
    "In a large bowl, use a hand mixer to beat together the cool whip, the cool whip frosting, and the whipped cream cheese until smooth. Spread over top of the cake.",
    "Pour the caramel sauce over top of the cake, and sprinkle with chopped pecans.",
    "Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, really overnight is best.",
    "Cut into 12 squares to serve (you can cut more, 1/12 is a pretty large piece!)."
