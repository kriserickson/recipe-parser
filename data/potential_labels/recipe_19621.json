    "Slice the flank steak as thinly as you can (1/4 inch (6.35 mm) or thinner), against the grain.",
    "In a large bowl or plastic bag, toss the flank steak with gelatin powder, until evenly coated.",
    "Place the steak into the slow cooker.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut aminos, minced garlic, sweetener, molasses, sesame oil, ground ginger, salt, and pepper. Pour the sauce over the steak in the slow cooker and stir to coat.",
    "Cover and cook for 4-6 hours on Low or 2-3 hours on High, until steak is tender and cooked through.",
    "Optional step: If you want a thicker sauce at the end, you can remove the meat, pour the sauce into a medium saucepan, and simmer for 10-15 minutes to reduce the sauce. Otherwise, feel free to skip this step and just drizzle the liquid over the meat for serving."
