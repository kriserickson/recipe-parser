    "In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, custard powder and tapioca starch. Set aside.",
    "In another bowl or large liquid measuring cup, lightly beat the eggs and whisk in the sugar. Mix in the evaporated milk and then water, gradually. Add the sifted flour mixture and whisk well, making sure there are no lumps. Whisk in the vanilla extract and then the oil. Cover the batter with plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for 1 hour or overnight.",
    "When you’re ready to make waffles, take the batter out and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
    "Heat up your waffle iron plates: brush or spray with a bit of oil and heat each one separately over medium heat.",
    "Pour a scant cup of batter (closer to 3/4 cup) into one of the plates, rotating so that most of the wells are filled. Place the other plate on top, lock it in, close, and flip. Cook each side for 2-3 minutes, lifting the plates to check after a minute and a half. Lift the top plate off and flip the waffle out – use chopsticks to loosen if needed – and let cool on a wire rack so the edges stay crispy. Repeat with the remaining batter. Enjoy warm!"
