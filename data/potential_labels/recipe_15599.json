    "In a small pot set over medium heat, combine the blackberries and REBBL protein. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, boil for 3 minutes, stirring frequently.",
    "Mash the berries, leaving some a little chunky for texture and cook and additional 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture forms a thick sauce. transfer to a small bowl and cover to keep warm.",
    "Rub a waffle iron with coconut oil and heat to the highest setting.",
    "In a medium bowl, stir together the almond flour, tapioca starch, coconut sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice and salt. Add in the REBBL protein and almond butter and whisk until smooth. Your batter will be a little thicker than normal waffles.",
    "Drop the batter in the center of the waffle iron and spread out just a little bit (it will not fill the whole iron which is normal!) Firmly close the waffle iron and cook until crispy - I like to run the waffle through 2 cooking cycles to make it super crispy!",
    "Pour the blackberry sauce on and DEVOUR!"
