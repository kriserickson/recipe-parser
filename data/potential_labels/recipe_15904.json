    "To make normal rice, pour 2 cups of water into a pot with 1 cup of uncooked rice and two pinches of salt. Thatâ€™ll be enough for two generous portions, or three or four smaller servings. With the lid off, bring to a low boil over medium heat, then turn the heat down to low and put the lid on slightly askew, so that the steam can escape. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the water is all gone."
