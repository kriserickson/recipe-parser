    "Combine the sauce ingredients together in a medium bowl. Measure out 3 tablespoons and add to a large mixing bowl. Set aside the saucepan. To the mixing bowl, lightly beat in the egg white and add chicken pieces. Mix well.",
    "In a large zip-top freezer bag, combine the almond meal, pork rinds, salt, and black pepper. Add the chicken and shake well to coat.",
    "Turn your Instant Pot to SAUTE then add in oil. Once oil is hot, add the chicken and cook for 1-2 minutes, until a brown coating appears (chicken will not be cooked through which is fine). You may have to work in batches.",
    "Once you've browned all the chicken, place back in the Instant Pot and pour in the remaining sauce along with 1/3 cup water (or chicken broth). Cover with lid.",
    "Press the valve to SEALING and press MANUAL or PRESSURE COOK for 4 minutes. The Instant Pot will take some time to come to pressure. Once the 4 minutes is up, use a long spoon and push the valve to VENTING for a QUICK RELEASE.",
    "Once all the pressure is released, carefully unlock the lid. Press the SAUTE button, then whisk the arrowroot starch (or xanthum gum) with 2 tablespoons water until combined and stir into the Instant Pot. Allow sauce to cook until it bubbles and thicken.",
    "Taste and adjust seasonings to what you prefer - add additional lemon for tangier, more sweetener for sweeter and sriracha for spicier, if desired."
