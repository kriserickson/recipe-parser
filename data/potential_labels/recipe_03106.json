    "Wash the passionfruits. Halve and scoop out the pulpy seeds. Put aside in the fridge.",
    "Put half the quantity of the shells in a pot and fill with enough water to just cover the tops. Boil for about 30 - 40 mins or until it turns translucent and soft. Drain & cool for easier handling. Save 1 cup of boiled liquid.",
    "When cooled, scoop out the inner flesh and discard the papery skins. Pulse in a food processor or blender until a smooth puree.",
    "Add to reserved seeds together with the lemon juice, reserved liquid and sugar in a deep stainless steel pot. Stir over medium heat until all the sugar has dissolved. Then bring to a boil. Reduce to fire to low, let it simmer for 15 mins without stirring too much except for the occasional scrape or two with a wooden spoon to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom and burn.",
    "Turn off heat and skim scum from the jam surface with spoon.",
    "Let it cool before ladling into clean, sterilized jars. Close lid and leave the jars upside down for 10 minutes. The jam will thicken up as it cools and store in the fridge. ***Do NOT add cold food to hot jars, or hot food to cold jars otherwise the jar will shatter."
