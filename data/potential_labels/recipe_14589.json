    "Cover your largest baking sheet with paper towels or paper bags for draining.",
    "Scrub potatoes and dab them dry, then cut into 1/4-inch batons (see here for how I do it). Place in a 4 to 5-quart heavy, deep frying pan or Dutch oven and add oil; it will barely cover the potatoes. Turn burner to high and bring oil to a boil, which will take about 5 minutes. Cook potatoes for another 15 minutes; do not stir; theyâ€™ll just break. At this 20 minute mark, you can use tongs or a thin spatula to gently scrape loose any potatoes that have stuck to the pan. Continue to cook, stirring only if absolutely necessary, for 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until crisp and as golden as you like them. Use a large slotted spoon or spider to scoop potatoes from and spread them on prepared tray drain, tossing immediately with salt as you do.",
    "You can keep fries warm in a 200 degree oven but the texture is really best right from the fryer."
