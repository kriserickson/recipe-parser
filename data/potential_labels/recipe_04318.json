    "Heat the 1 tablespoon of oil in a medium skillet. Add the cumin seeds and cook over moderate heat until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add the ginger, jalapeño, coriander and cayenne and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add the green peas and the water and cook until the peas are tender and most of the water has evaporated, 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and let cool slightly. Add the cilantro and pomegranate molasses and pulse until the peas are finely chopped. Season with salt.",
    "Arrange the empanada wrappers on a work surface and brush the edges with water. Divide the filling among the wrappers. Fold the dough over and pinch from the bottom to the center to form a cone. Fold the top of the dough down to meet the edges and pinch well to seal, forming a triangular dumpling.",
    "In a deep, medium skillet, heat 3/4 inch of oil to 350°. Fry the samosas over moderately high heat, turning once, until golden and crisp, 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel–lined rack. Serve with cilantro and tamarind chutneys."
