    "DIRECTIONS:",
    "In a mixing bowl, add the diced chicken, corn starch, salt and black pepper. Stir together until the chicken is well-coated in the corn starch.",
    "In a non-stick 12-inch skillet, heat the 1 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium heat. Cook the chicken, turning the pieces over every so often for about 6 minutes or until the chicken is cooked thoroughly. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover to keep warm.",
    "In another bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, hoisin, apricot jam, rice vinegar, balsamic vinegar, sriracha, and the water.",
    "Place the skillet back onto the heat. Add the remaining vegetable oil for the sauce. Add the garlic and grated ginger and cook for about 30 seconds. Pour in the sauce mixed and whisk until the sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes. Add the cooked chicken back in with the sauce and toss to coat. Serve over rice or vegetables. Top with sesame seeds and/or sliced green onion if desired."
