    "This must be chilled overnight for the cookies to soften! We are talking 24 hours or more-a little tip to speed the softening up....halve the cookies lengthwise (don't worry about the cream) and layer them halved. Or you could even chop the cookies and use chopped cookies in the layers! Either way you choose will be delicious!!!"
