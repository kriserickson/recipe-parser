    "Start by cooking the farro. Bring 1/2 cup farro and 1 cup (salted) water to a gentle boil. Reduce and simmer for about 25-35 minutes. (Check it at the 15-20 minute mark, give it a stir to make sure it’s not burning/sticking to the bottom of the pot. It’s done when it’s tender and chewy, not crunchy and not mushy).",
    "Drain farro, shaking out excess water. Toss it with olive oil, salt, pepper and the arugula.",
    "Drizzle with balsamic vinegar, lemon, lemon zest, some of the pesto, some of the grated cheese and toss again. Taste and adjust seasonings.",
    "Finish the salad with radishes, a few more dollops of pesto, and another grating of cheese on top."
