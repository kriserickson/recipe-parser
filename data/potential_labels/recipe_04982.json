    "6. Roll sheet, applying pressure as you roll. The rice will make the roll stick together, so don’t worry about it falling apart. Once you’ve almost finished, add a little extra pressure on the overlap between the two seaweed layers to ensure that the burrito stays together. The overlap should be about one inch. To make the burrito look prettier, cut the ends so that they are even and neat. You can also wrap it in paper once you’ve finished rolling the burrito. I used parchment paper and rolled the burrito in it and twisted the bottom to prevent the burrito from falling apart.",
