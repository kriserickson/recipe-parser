    "Heat 2 tsp. of canola oil in a large skill over medium heat. Saute the diced onions until they are soft, about 5 minutes.",
    "Combine the black beans, brown rice, and onion in a food processor. Pulse until all items are well combined (i.e., no visibly whole pieces of bean)",
    "Scoop the bean mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the flour and spices. Stir to combine.",
    "To make the sausage patties, divide the bean mixture into twelve pieces and roll each piece into a ball. (A little flour on your hands will help with the stickiness.) Place one of the balls between your palms, and squash it into a pattie shape.",
    "Add a little more oil to your skillet and turn it down to medium low. Add the black bean sausage patties to the pan, and brown on each side."
