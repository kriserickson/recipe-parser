    "1 This is an optional step. Preheat oven to 300 F. Place almond slivers on a baking sheet in a single layer and toast for 10 minutes, turning once. Let cool.",
    "2 Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat and set aside. Mix together white and brown sugar and baking soda in a 3-quart saucepan. Stir in light cream and place over medium to medium-high heat. Cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture reaches 235°F on a candy thermometer (about 25 minutes). Slight foaming and occasional bubbling in the mixture (it looks like it’s gasping) are normal at this stage.",
    "3 As soon as the temperature reaches 235 F, add the butter and stir until the butter is fully melted and the mixture is well combined (about 1 minute).",
    "4 Remove the mixture from the heat and stir in the brandy and pecans until well coated. Continue stirring to cool slightly (about 1-2 minutes). Quickly drop by spoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets. Let cool completely.",
    "Store in an airtight container for up to 3-5 days."
