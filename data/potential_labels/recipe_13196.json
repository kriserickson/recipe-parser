    "Cut fish into 2 inch squares. Season the fish with a little garlic salt and pepper. Dredge fish in flour. Tap the excess flour off the fish. In a pan, heat the oil and butter until butter is melted. On medium heat pan fry the fish on each side until lightly browned. Take off the fish from the pan and set aside. Add chicken broth into to the frying pan and cream. Season with salt and pepper; add paprika and lemon juice and bring it to a boil. Add fish into the sauce and let it simmer for 7-10 minutes. The sauce will thicken as it cooks. If the sauce is too thick, add some more chicken stock or water to reach your desired sauce consistency.",
    "Serve with Cilantro Lemon Rice, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.",
