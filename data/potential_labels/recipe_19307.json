    "Cook the noodles according to package directions. Drain, rinse and set aside.",
    "While the noodles cook, in a medium pot, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the sweet potato, ginger, garlic and red curry paste. Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture turns a shade darker and begins to stick to the bottom of the pot, 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "Stir in the coconut milk, snow peas, 1 cup water and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until the snow peas are bright green and the sweet potato is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.",
    "Remove from heat. Cut the lime in half; squeeze one half into the curry and cut the other half into four wedges. Divide the noodles among bowls, top with the curry and herbs. Squeeze more lime juice over as desired."
