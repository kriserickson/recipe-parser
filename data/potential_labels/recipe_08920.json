    "Put the eggs, lemon juice, salt and cayenne in the blender. Pulse a few times to mix. Scrape down sides of blender.",
    "Melt the butter in the microwave or in a small saucepan over low heat until melted and steaming.",
    "With the blender running at medium speed, slowly drizzle the butter into the eggs. It should thicken by the time you've added all the butter. Continue to blend for an additional 30 seconds for additional thickness. Serve immediately. (You can reheat hollandaise sauce slowly in the microwave, 15 seconds at a time stirring between heats, just until warm, not hot."
