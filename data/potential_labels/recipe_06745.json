    "Step 1",
    "Set the Anova Sous Vide Precision Cooker to 195ºF (90.6ºC). Generously grease 4 half-pint canning jars with non-stick oil spray or butter.",
    "Step 2",
    "Prepare a double boiler by placing a large bowl over a medium saucepan filled with 1 inch of water. Bring water to a simmer over medium heat.",
    "Step 3",
    "Place butter and chocolate in the bowl of the double boiler and let melt, stirring frequently. (You can also melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave in short, 30-second bursts, stirring after each burst.)",
    "Step 4",
    "Remove the bowl from the double boiler and place on a kitchen towel. Whisk in sugar until combined. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, until smooth. Whisk in vanilla.",
    "Step 5",
    "Gently fold in flour and salt until just combined.",
    "Step 6",
    "Divide the batter between the prepared jars. Each jar should be no more than half full. Wipe off sides and tops of jars using a damp towel. Firmly tap jars on the counter to remove air bubbles.",
    "Step 7",
    "Place lids and bands on jars and seal until just tight (do not over-tighten jars; air will still need to escape). Place jars in water bath and set the timer for 3 hours."
