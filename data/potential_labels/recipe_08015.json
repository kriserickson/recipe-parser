    "Hard boil the eggs. Place the eggs in a saucepan and add enough cold water to cover them by about an inch. Cover the pan with a lid and bring the water to a boil over high heat. As soon as the water begins boiling, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it stand, covered, for about 15 minutes. Drain the water and run cold water over the eggs until they are cooled. To peel, crack the shell all over by gently tapping it on the counter. Roll the egg between your hands to loosen the shell, and begin peeling.",
    "Place Greek yogurt, lemon juice, mustard, tabasco sauce, and salt in the container of your blender. Add one egg and blend well. Continue adding eggs, one at a time, until mixture is smooth and light. Blend in the cream cheese.",
    "Spoon dip into a bowl, cover, and chill for at least one hour. Garnish with paprika or cayenne pepper and serve with crackers or raw veggie sticks."
