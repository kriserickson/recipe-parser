    "For sweet chile sauce: Place vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan and simmer until sugar dissolves, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in chile sauce and cornstarch slurry and bring to a boil. Once mixture has come to a boil, remove from heat and allow to cool (sauce will thicken as it cools).",
    "For meatballs: Preheat oven to 375˚F. Place bread and milk in a large mixing bowl and soak for 30 minutes. Add ground meat and gently mix together. Add remaining ingredients and mix together until well combined. (be careful not to over mix the mixture)",
    "Roll small balls (about 2 teaspoons) with the meat mixture and place onto a baking sheet 1/2 inch apart. Bake meatballs for 18 to 20 minutes or until they’re completely cooked through. Allow meatballs to rest for 5 minutes before brushing with glaze. Serve."
