    "Quarter cabbage lengthwise; cut out and discard core. Thinly slice cabbage crosswise; set aside. In large pot or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat; cover and cook leek and garlic, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add cabbage, stock, salt, pepper and nutmeg; cook, covered and stirring occasionally, until wilted, about 15 minutes. Stir in flour; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in cream and bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Spread in greased 12-inch (2 L) oval baking dish. Topping: Combine bread crumbs, cheese, butter and thyme; sprinkle over cabbage mixture. (Make-ahead: Let cool. Cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Bring to room temperature to bake.) Bake in 400°F (200°C) oven until bubbling and topping is golden, about 20 minutes."
