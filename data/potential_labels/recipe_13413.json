    "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a bowl combine the honey, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil and teriyaki sauce. Peel the ginger and grate it into the bowl using a small cheese grater. Mince the garlic and add it as well. Stir it all to combine.",
    "Place the chicken wings in a colander and rinse well (you don’t know what gets on them in the factory). Cut each wing at the joint to yield a drummet and a wing (see photos below). Add the wings to the bowl of sauce and stir to coat.",
    "Spray a glass baking dish well with non-stick spray to make clean up easy. Dump the whole bowl of wings and sauce into the baking dish. Bake at 450 degrees for 25 minutes, stirring once after 15 minutes to recoat the wings in sauce.",
    "After 25 minutes of baking, stir the wings to recoat with sauce then turn the oven on to broil. Broil for 3-5 minutes, stir then broil again for 3-5 minutes. Because broiling cooks fast and every oven is different, keep an eye on the wings. Stir them when the tops have turned nice and brown and then broil the other side. For me it was between 3-5 minutes. The sauce should have reduced and thickened significantly during the broiling stage.",
    "Let the wings cool for 5 minutes before serving. The sauce will thicken further as it cools. Stir the wings around in the sauce to coat them well before serving. Sprinkle sliced green onions on top."
