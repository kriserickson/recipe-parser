    "Put the curry paste and coconut milk in a small to medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir until the curry paste dissolves into the coconut milk and the mixture comes to a boil. Adjust the heat to maintain a respectable simmer, and cook until the mixture has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the tofu and stir gently until hot. Remove from the heat and stir in the basil and lime juice. Serve at once."
