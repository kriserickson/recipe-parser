    "PREPARATION",
    "Place beets in a large pot. Pour in cold water to cover; season with salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 40â€“60 minutes. Drain and let beets cool. Slip skins off with your hands (wear gloves to avoid staining if you have them) and slice into wedges. Place in a large bowl.",
    "Meanwhile, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over high. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 6 minutes.",
    "Whisk vinegar, honey, garlic, 1/4 cup oil, and remaining 1 1/2 tsp. salt in a small bowl. Add mushrooms to dressing and let sit to pickle at least 30 minutes.",
    "Wipe out skillet. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium-high. Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and tender, about 4 minutes. Let cool.",
    "Pour dressing off mushrooms over beets in bowl. Add tarragon and toss to coat. Top with shallots and pickled mushrooms; season with pepper.",
    "Do Ahead: Beets can be boiled 2 days ahead. Do not peel; cover and chill. Dressing can be made and mushrooms pickled 1 day ahead; cover and chill separately."
