    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Pizza",
    "Stir the sugar and active dry yeast into the warm water until it dissolves. Set aside and let it rise for 12-15 minutes.",
    "Sift the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Once the yeast is ready, pour it into the bowl, along with the olive oil. Knead the dough on a surface dusted with flour, for 3 minutes.",
    "Place the dough ball in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, for 30 minutes.",
    "(Make the Ranch)",
    "Preheat oven for 425ºF, with pizza stone inside (if you’re using one).",
    "Take the raised dough and knead for another 1-2 minutes. Roll out flat, to about ½” thick; then carefully stretch the dough out with your hands until it is 14″ wide.",
    "Make sure to leave the dough a little thicker around the edges for a good crust.",
    "Place the dough onto a pan or pizza stone that has a thin layer of corn meal on it, and bake for 5 minutes. Make sure to pop any large air bubbles while it’s baking.",
    "Toss the cooked chickpeas with 3 T. of buffalo sauce and set aside.",
    "Take the crust out of the oven, spread the remaining buffalo sauce over it, leaving an inch or so for the crust.",
    "Next, layer the toppings in this order: arugula, red onion, bell pepper, and buffalo chickpeas. Brush a little olive oil onto the crust. Bake for an additional 10-12 minutes.",
    "Once the crust is nice and golden take the pizza out of the oven and top with celery, ranch sauce (you can leave extra for dipping as there is a good amount of it) and cilantro.",
    "Serve!",
    "Ranch Dressing",
    "Place all ingredients into a blender and puree until smooth. Season to taste and place in the refrigerator while you’re waiting for the pizza to finish."
