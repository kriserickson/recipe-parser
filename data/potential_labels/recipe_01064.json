    "Mash the banana and put it into a bowl with the oats and milk - mix well until everything is incorporated.Â You can either leave this mixture in the bowl and cover it with clingfilm or transfer it into an empty jar with a lid (I usually use an old jam jar). Leave it in the fridge to soak overnight, top it with whatever you like in the morning and enjoy!"
