    "This recipe is from Mark's Daily Apple blog. Mark added a squeeze of lemon juice which I left out. I'm not crazy about the taste of lemon in savory dishes. This makes a large portion so it made a very filling lunch for me. Go easy on the salt because the bacon adds a lot of saltiness. Click the photo to see a close-up."
