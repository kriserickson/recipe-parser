    "Place the salmon in the freezer for 20 minutes — not so long that it freezes, but just enough that it's firm. Finely chop the salmon by hand (You don’t want salmon purée or paté, which results in a dense burger; 1/8- to 1/4-inch pieces are ideal.)",
    "Lightly beat the egg in a large bowl. Stir in the salmon, red pepper, mint, cilantro, scallions, lime juice, salt, and panko. Mix thoroughly.",
    "To form the patties, first divide the mixture into four even piles. With slightly damp hands, and working with one pile at a time, gently form the mixture in a ball, then flatten the ball into a 1-inch-thick disk. Don’t mash or overly compact the patties, but work them enough that the burgers really hold their shape.",
    "Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add the patties and cook about 4 minutes per side (for a pink center).",
    "While the patties cook, make the lime mayonnaise: Combine the mayonnaise, lime juice and zest.",
    "Serve the burgers on the English muffins, topped with the lime mayonnaise."
