    "Marinade: To make the marinade, add apple, garlic, soy sauce, gochujang, chilli flakes and ginger to a food processor. Pulse till a smooth paste forms.",
    "Slow Cooker Recipe: In the slow cooker, add onions, pork, honey, salt and the marinade from the food processor. Cook on low for 7-8 hours or high for 3-4 hours. Once the pork is cooked through, skim the fat from the top of the pork and discard. Add the bell peppers and cook on high for 15-20 minutes. Top with sesame seeds and chopping spring onions. Serve over rice with a 6 minute egg.",
    "Stove Top Recipe: Marinate the pork in the paste for at least 2 hours or overnight. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil (not mentioned in the recipe ingredients) in a wok and add onions. Stir fry on high for a minute or two and add the marinated pork with all the liquid. Cook on medium high heat for 10-15 minutes till the meat is cooked through and caramelized. Add bell peppers and stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes. Top with sesame seeds and chopping spring onions. Serve over rice with a 6 minute egg."
