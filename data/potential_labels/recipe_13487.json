    "1 Blanch the asparagus: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. (You will cook both the asparagus and the pasta in the same pot of water.) Add a couple teaspoons of salt. Have an ice bath ready. Add the asparagus and cook until tender but firm, about 4 minutes.",
    "Remove the asparagus with tongs and place in the ice bath to stop the cooking.",
    "2 Cut the asparagus into 1/8-inch diagonal slices, leaving the tips intact.",
    "3 Cook the pasta: Bring the water back to a boil and add the penne pasta.",
    "4 Make the ricotta sauce: While the penne is cooking, rub the inside of a large serving bowl with the mashed garlic. Discard the garlic. Add the ricotta, olive oil, and 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water. Mix together in the bowl.",
    "5 Add pasta to the ricotta mixture, with asparagus and parm: When the pasta is done, drain it, reserving some of the cooking water. Add the penne to the ricotta mixture. Fold in the asparagus and half of the Parmesan cheese.",
    "Season to taste with salt, pepper, and several dashes of nutmeg. Add some of the reserved pasta water if needed.",
    "6 Serve with remaining grated Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl for sprinkling."
