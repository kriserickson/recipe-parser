    "Boil water, add salt, and then add pasta. Cook according to package instructions. Pasta with grooves is best.",
    "Add sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil, basil, garlic, and 2 Tbsp vegan parmesan cheese to a food processor or high-speed blender and puree into a pesto-like consistency.",
    "If it has trouble mixing, add a bit of hot pasta water (2-3 Tbsp) to help encourage it along. It doesnâ€™t need to be finely pureed, just well mixed. I think a bit of texture is a good thing in this dish.",
    "Add drained pasta back to the pot you cooked it in and add pesto. Toss to coat and season with a bit more olive oil and vegan parmesan.",
    "Serve warm with additional fresh basil and vegan parmesan cheese. Store covered in the fridge for up to a few days, though best when fresh.",
    "This can be enjoyed hot, slightly chilled or at room temperature, making it ideal for picnics and take-along lunches!"
