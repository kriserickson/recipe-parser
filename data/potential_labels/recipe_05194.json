    "Crush fennel and cumin seeds in a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. Place ingredients for the spice paste into a food processor and blend 1 minute, until smooth. In a large pot on medium low heat, fry the spice paste for 4 to 5 minutes, until thick and fragrant. Add coconut milk and water and bring to a boil. If you are using chicken breasts, cut them in half. Bruise the lemon grass stalks thoroughly with the back of a knife. Add lemon grass and chicken pieces to pot, bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer 40 minutes. Peel potatoes and cut into large chunks. Add potatoes to the pot and simmer 20 minutes. Taste sauce and season with salt if desired. Remove and discard lemon grass. Peel and halve the eggs. Serve in bowls, each garnished with a half egg and cilantro leaves. Serve with Kokuho Rose rice on the side."
