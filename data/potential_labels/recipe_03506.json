    "Step 1 - Whisk the coconut milk, honey and vanilla together until the honey and vanilla is dispersed. Taste for sweetness and add more honey if you want more. Switch to a flat bottomed spatula and add the chia seeds and stir until combined (make sure to get the chia seeds at the bottom too). Allow to sit for at least two hours until the seeds swell and the pudding thickens.",
