    "After 48 hours put all the jars in the fridge and forget about them for at least a month.",
    "After four weeks they are ready to use. They will keep all year like this, so you can use them anytime you desire to make Dolmas."

    "The whey (optional) that is called for in the recipe is made by taking plain yogurt that has live cultures in it and putting it in a clean cloth inside a large mesh strainer (I use a bandanna). Put the strainer over a bowl and allow it to drip for several hours. The liquid in the bowl is the whey, the leftover yogurt can be used something like a cream cheese. See this link for detailed instructions with photos.",
