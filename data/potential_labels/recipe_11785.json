    "In a large bowl, stir the buckwheat flour, almond meal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and sugar together. Add the liquid stevia, butter, eggs, and milk, stirring until well combined (the batter will be slightly lumpy). Gently fold in the pecans.",
    "Heat a skillet over medium heat, and spray with oil. Scoop 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet, and cook on one side until bubbles begin to form and the edges appear slightly dry. Flip, and cook on the other side for another minute. Remove to a plate, and repeat with the remaining batter.",
    "To keep the pancakes heated while cooking the remaining batter, turn the oven on warm (about 200ÂºF) and place a sturdy plate (or oven proof dish) in the oven. Transfer the cooked pancakes in there to stay warm.",
    "Serve immediately with butter and/or maple syrup."
