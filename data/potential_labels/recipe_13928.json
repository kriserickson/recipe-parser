    "Marinate the chicken with soy sauce, rice wine (if using), sesame oil and corn starch. Stir to mix well. In a small bowl, mix all the ingredients for the Sauce together. Stir to mix well. Set aside.",
    "Heat up a skillet or wok on high heat. Add 1/2 tablespoon oil and add the chicken. Toss and stir fry until the surface turns white but not completely cooked. Dish out and set aside. Clean up the skillet or wok with paper towels, and add the remaining 1 tablespoon cooking oil. When the oil is heated, add the garlic and ginger, stir fry until aromatic. Add the chicken and do a few quick stirs before adding the Sauce. Stir continuously until the sauce thickens and the chicken is cooked through. Add the scallions, stir to combine well. Top the chicken with some sesame and serve immediately."
