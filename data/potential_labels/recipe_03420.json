    "NOTE: I recommend roasting several peppers at once and using for other recipes. Try Homemade Tomato Paste which is delicious as a spread or in pasta dishes.",
    "Place whole bell peppers on a cookie sheet lined with foil. Turn peppers over every 10 minutes. Cook approximately 30 minutes or until skins are charred. Immediately place peppers in a large bowl and cover with foil to seal in the steam. After 45 minutes remove core, seeds, and peelings and discard.",

    "Brush oil evenly over one side of bread slices. Heat either a Panini press or nonstick skillet to 350 degrees or medium heat. Add to dry side of 4 slices of bread: roasted pepper strips, onion, tomato, goat cheese, thyme, and salt pepper. Place other slice of bread on top, oil side up.",
    "Heat Panini until bread is crispy and all the ingredients are hot."
