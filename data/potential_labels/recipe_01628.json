    "Place the Guinness in a large saucepan and reduce to one-fifth of its volume. Cool and set aside.",
    "To make the Guinness Butter, whip the butter for 5-10 minutes until very pale and fluffy. Add in the remaining ingredients except for the Guinness and whip until combined. Add the reduced Guinness a little at a time until all combined. Roll in plastic wrap and place in the fridge until firm.",
    "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celcius (180 degrees Celcius fan forced). Remove the backbone and wishbone of the chicken and press down on the breast to butterfly the bird. Loosen the skin from the breasts and thighs. Take about 3/4 of a cup of the Guinness Butter and stuff it underneath the skin. Spread a further 1/4 cup over the skin of the bird and season with additional flake salt. Roast for 35-45 minutes, basting occasionally until the chicken is cooked through. If the skin is not browned to your liking, grill under a hot grill for a further 5-10 minutes. Set aside in a warm place to rest for 10-15 minutes.",
    "Serve with salad leaves and your preferred accompaniments."
