    "milk with the vanilla stevia. Add the remaining ingredients until you have a thick ganache-type mixture. Divide into two mini cupcake cups (I use silicone ones) and freeze for at least 15 minutes. If serving bites after they have been in the freezer overnight or longer, allow to thaw for about half an hour before serving."
