    "HOMEMADE SRIRACHA",
    "makes about 1 cup",
    "INGREDIENTS",
    "6 red jalapeno peppers, chopped (seed jalapeno if your prefer less spicy)",
    "2 tablespoon tomato paste",
    "4 garlic cloves",
    "3-4 tablespoon apple cider vinegar",
    "2 tablespoon coconut amino",
    "3 California dates (may need less if you seed jalapeno)",
    "salt, to taste",
    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Put everything in a food processor or a blender until it's pureed.",
    "Notes:- If you can't handle too spicy, I recommend removing the seeds. The original recipe calls for cooking the sauce further to concentrate the flavor and it removes the raw vegetable flavor. I enjoyed it as it but feel free to simmer it for 10 minutes..."
