    "Build a fire in your grill, leaving about 1/3 of grill free of coals, or set a gas grill to high.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk together the tamari or soy sauce with the vinegar. Add the olive oil while whisking vigorously. Add the broccoli and toss to coat. Sprinkle lightly with kosher salt.",
    "Place a grill basket on the grill and add the broccoli to it. Grill, tossing frequently, until the florets are crisp at the edges and tender within, with just a little bit of bite to them, approximately 10 to 12 minutes. If you donâ€™t have a grill basket, lay the florets out on the grill in a single level and use tongs to turn them often. More work, same result.",
    "Transfer the cooked broccoli to a platter, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with parsley and, if using, a pinch or two of flaky sea salt."
