    "For the crust: Place the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse a couple times to blend.",
    "Add the butter, cream cheese, and sour cream. Pulse until crumbly; this will take 30 seconds or so. Pulse until there are pea-sized crumbs throughout. See photo above for a visual.",
    "Divide the dough into three equal portions and gently flatten into a disc shape. Wrap in plastic wrap, then chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to 1 day. Or freeze for up to 3 months and thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.",
    "For the filling: Pulse the brown sugar, walnuts, raisins, and cinnamon in the food processor until very finely chopped and well combined. The filling will feel a little moist. You'll have a little over 2 cups total.",
    "Line 3 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
    "Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Working with one disc of dough at a time and on a lightly floured work surface, roll into a 10-inch circle (roughly 1/4 inch thick, give or take) and brush it lightly with water. Spread about 1/3 of the filling on top. Gently press the filling down into the dough so it's compact.",
    "Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut the dough into 8 equal wedges. If you’re cutting on a silicone mat, be careful not to cut the mat. Roll each wedge up, beginning with the wide end and ending with the narrow end. Place the rolls point-side down onto the baking sheets, 8 on each. Repeat with the remaining two discs of dough.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C).",
    "Bake the rugelach for 25 - 30 minutes, or until golden brown. As the rugelach bake, the butter will lightly fry their bottoms, giving them a super crunchy crust.",
    "Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve warm or at room temperature. Cover leftovers and store tightly at room temperature for up to 5 days."
