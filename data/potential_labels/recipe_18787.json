    "Freeze the strawberries in a zipper-lock bag at least 1 day in advance of making the sangria.",
    "Use a 12-cup muffin pan to make large ice cubes. Place a sprig of fresh mint in 6 of the muffin slots, then fill those slots ¾ full of water. Freeze until firm, about 5 hours. To remove the cubes, set the bottom of the muffin pan in a sink with just a little hot water.",
    "Combine the peaches, orange, blueberries and blackberries in a large punch bowl.",
    "Pour the wine, Curaçao and lemonade over the fruit in the bowl, and stir gently to combine. Place the punch in the refrigerator, and let sit for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.",
    "When ready to serve, add the sparkling water to the bowl, and stir gently again. Add the frozen strawberries and the mint ice cubes."
