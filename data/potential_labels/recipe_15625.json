    "Instructions",
    "Boil oxtail with salt, pepper and some chopped onions in a medium pot until tender. It will take approximately 40 to 45 minutes. I used pressure cooker to shorten the process. Reserve the stock for later use. Remove fatty oil if desired",
    "Add Â½ cup oil to the pot/pan and fry the oxtail for about 5 minutes.",
    "Then, add the chopped garlic to perfume the oil and meat , continue frying the meat for1- 2 minutes, be careful not to let the garlic burn",
    "Next add tomato sauce, tomato paste, curry and fresh thyme . Stir the pot frequently to prevent the sauce from sticking to the pot",
    "Add salt and bouillon according to preference with about 2 cups of stock. Bring to a boil and let it simmer to blend all the flavors and reduce acidity of the tomato sauce. Approximately 30-40 minutes. Stir occasionally adding water as needed",
    "Finally add green onions and green pepper. Adjust seasonings, soup consistency with water/stock and salt.",
    "Serve warm with desired side dish."
