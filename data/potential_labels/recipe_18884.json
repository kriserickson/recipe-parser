    "In a large pot on high heat, cook the onion in oil. Add splashes of water to prevent burning. StirÂ until the onions lightly caramelize, about 15 minutes.",
    "Add the crushed garlic and cook while stirring until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Then add the remaining ingredients, except the dry quinoa, bring to a boil, and reduce to a simmer. Cook uncovered until the potatoes are cooked, about 20 minutes.",
    "In a separate small pot, bring the quinoa and water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered until quinoa is cooked, about 15 minutes.",
    "Using an immersion blender, puree the soup to the desired consistency. If using a blender, I recommend blending half. Remove the pot from the heat to avoid splatter after the soup has been pureed. Stir in the quinoa or use it as a garnish on top. Enjoy!"
