    "Heat coconut milk in a small sauce pan over medium-high heat. Whisk in red curry paste, brown sugar, soy sauce, peanut butter, lime juice, and garlic and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and allow sauce to simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Once sauce is thick, stir in crushed peanuts and remove from heat.",
    "While sauce is simmering prepare the rest of the ingredients. Heat a lightly-oiled griddle over medium-high heat and place the curry satays on griddle. Sauté for about 4 minutes. Flip and sauté the other side until seitan is warmed all the way through. Set aside.",
    "Heat up a small sauce pan and add broccoli florets along with 1-2 tablespoons water. Cover and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.",
    "To assemble, divide the rice evenly among bowls. Add broccoli, cabbage, spinach, and 2-3 curry satays to each bowl. Top with Red Curry Peanut Sauce and toppings of choice.",
    "Serve immediately."
