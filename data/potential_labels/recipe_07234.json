    "Method:",
    "In a bowl, prepare the marinade. Lightly beat the egg white, and mix well with the rest of the marinade ingredients. Marinade the chicken, coat well and let it sit, making sure that all the egg whites are well soaked at the end of the marination process. This will ensure a smooth and silky texture when the chicken is cooked. Discard any excess marinade.",
    "In a wok, heat 1/3 cup of oil to smoky hot, gently drop slices of chicken in, constantly stir-fry until the chicken is a little over half done, for about 45 seconds, or until the chicken turns silky white on the surface and still pink on the inside. Dish out, drain on paper towels and set aside. Reserve 2 tablespoon oil for later. Scrape off any excess on the wok, and rinse the wok well.",
    "Heat up wok with 2 tablespoons oil, stir-fry minced garlic until lightly browned and fragrant. Toss in the peas, carrots and continue to stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add in mushrooms and stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes.",
    "Toss in the chicken, mix well and quickly pour in the White Sauce seasoning. Stir well, cover the wok and gently simmer on medium heat until chicken is completely cooked and sauce has thickened. Remove wok cover, adjust salt, sugar, or other flavorings as per taste. Dish up and serve with hot steamed rice."
