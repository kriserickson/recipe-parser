    "Preheat your oven to 375F. Place your sweet potato and onion onto a large baking dish with coconut oil and season with sea salt and pepper. Bake for 45 minutes to an hour, basically until the potato is fork tender. Check it at 45 minutes to make sure you don’t overcook it.",
    "When the sweet potato is done, place the kale onto a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and balsamic. Bake it for about 10-15 minutes at 350F. You can cook it at the same time as the sweet potato if you like, just be aware that you will cook it for less time due to the temp of your oven.",
    "Once all your ingredients are cooked, place them into a large bowl and mix together. Sprinkle with cooked quinoa (great to use leftovers) or hemp seeds if that’s not too hippie dippie for you! I love hemp and you don’t have to cook it."
