    "Add the rice, lentils and squash to the food processor. Add the vegetables and process until the whole thing comes together and kind of pulls away from the sides of the processor bowl (kind of like dough.) Turn out into a bowl and divide up the mixture so that the burgers end up the same size.",
    "Pan fry until heated through or bake in a 350 oven for 30 minutes. Freeze any leftover burgers using parchment paper to separate them in the container. Enjoy!"
