Transfer to a small bowl and toss with ½ cup Parmesan and 1 Tbsp. thyme leaves; season with salt and pepper and set aside.",
    "Bring cream, broth, thyme sprigs, and remaining 2 Tbsp. butter to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat; season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit 10 minutes; discard thyme. Cover; keep warm.",
