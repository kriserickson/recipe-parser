    "1 Place the blueberries, sugar, honey, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt in a large bowl. Stir to coat blueberries with the sugar. Mash with a potato masher.",
    "2 Put the mashed blueberries into a blender and blend for a couple of minutes until smooth.",
    "3 Place a sieve over a large bowl and working in batches, press the mixture through the sieve, using a rubber spatula. This will catch the tougher and larger pieces of lemon and blueberry peel.",
    "4 Chill the mixture for at least an hour in the fridge. Then process following the directions of your ice cream maker.",
    "Eat immediately (the sorbet will still be a little soft) or freeze at least a few hours to help firm up before eating. Eat soon after making though, as the sorbet will get progressively harder the longer it stays in the freezer.",
    "Serve with a few fresh blueberries and a sprig of mint."
