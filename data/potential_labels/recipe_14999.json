    "1 Using a spiralizer or other spiral vegetable slicing tool, use the zucchini to make the zucchini noodles following manufacturer's directions. You should have 5 to 6 cups of \"zoodles\". Place in a colander set over a bowl and toss with salt. Let the noodles drain a bit of their excess moisture while you prep the other vegetables.",
    "Many of the noodles are quite long, so you'll want to cut them up a bit with scissors to make them easier to toss with the other vegetables.",
    "2 Place the zucchini noodles in a large bowl. Add the cabbage, carrot, bell pepper, onions, and cilantro.",
    "3 Whisk together in a medium bowl the seasoned rice vinegar, olive oil, dark sesame oil, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes.",
    "4 Pour the dressing over the zucchini noodles and vegetables and gently toss to combine.",
    "Serve immediately."
