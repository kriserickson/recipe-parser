    "Prepare dressing by placing ingredients in a high-speed blender and blending until smooth and creamy. (This will make more than you need, but it can be difficult for some blenders to blend smaller quantities.)",
    "If you haven't cooked the edamame yet, start that now.",
    "Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat. Add chickpeas and allow them to toast for about 5-8 minutes, or until they start to brown. Drizzle olive oil over chickpeas. Add salt, cumin, cayenne pepper and ginger. Stir to coat. Add cashews and stir together; continue to cook mixture over medium-high heat until cashews begin to lightly brown.",
    "Add chickpea/cashew mixture, edamame and apples to a medium bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add 3 tablespoons of avocado-lime dressing. Toss to coat. For a creamier salad, add more dressing. Garnish with chopped basil and serve warm."
