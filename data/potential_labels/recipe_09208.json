    "Rinse, peel and dice potatoes to about Â¼ inch cubes. Set aside. Take your corned beef and finely chop. Next comes the onions. If I have left over onions from making corned beef and cabbage, this is a great way to use them up. I Finely chop the cooked onions and set aside. If you don't have onions that are already cooked, take raw onions and saute them in butter until they become translucent in color.",
    "Take your diced potatoes and boil for 5 minutes. Drain potatoes, rinsing them with cold water to stop the cooking process.",
    "Next take a large skillet and melt 4 tablespoons of butter on medium heat. Add diced boiled potatoes to skillet along with onion and corned beef. Season with salt and pepper and a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Cook corned beef hash until the meat gets nice and crispy, stirring and flipping the mixture often so as not to burn. It usually takes a good 20 minutes to get it to perfection. Serve corned beef hash with pan fried eggs and toast."
