    "Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Place the chicken wings on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Evenly space the chicken wings on the tray and season with salt. Let sit for 15 minutes. Bake the wings for 25 minutes.",
    "While the chicken wings bake, make the sauce. In a small sauce pot, combine the sugar, tamari, fish sauce, lime juice and zest, white pepper, garlic and serrano chile. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is syrupy, for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.",
    "Transfer the baked wings to a large bowl, and pour half the sauce over. Toss with tongs to coat the wings evenly, then return them to the baking sheet and bake for 15 more minutes, until crispy and caramelized.",
    "Return the wings to the bowl, add the sesame seeds and cilantro, and toss to coat. Transfer to a platter and serve hot, with the remaining sauce alongside for dipping.",
