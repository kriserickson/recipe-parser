    "Pre-heat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6",
    "Cook the potatoes in some salted water for 12 minutes until tender. Meanwhile peel and chop the onion. Chop the peppers into small chunks, discard any seeds or green stalk.",
    "Whilst the potatoes are still warm, put into a food processor along with the chopped peppers and red onion. Season with the garlic granules and some black pepper, then pulse until you have a coarse sloppy potato mix. You may have to do this in two lots, depending on the size of your food processor. Add 25g of the flour and mix well, then put in the fridge for 20 minutes to cool.",
    "Cook the pork as per instructions on the pack for 30 minutes.",
    "Divide the cooled potato mixture into four. Using the rest of the flour, mould and shape into 4 patties. Sauté them in a little oil in a frying pan for 3 minutes each side. Serve them topped with the pulled pork."
