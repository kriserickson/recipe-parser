    "Place a large pot over medium-high heat, and add in the oil; once the oil is hot, add in all of the ingredients from the celery through the red pepper flake, and stir to combine; next, add in the tomato paste, and stir in to incorporate; add the cilantro leaves, the hot stock and the broken-up tortilla chips, stir, and allow the soup the come to the boil; once it comes to the boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer the soup for about 20-22 minutes, until veggies are tender and the chips are pretty dissolved into the soup; after 20-22 minutes, turn the heat off, and using a hand-held immersion blender (or working in batches using a blender – be careful with hot liquids!), puree the soup until smooth; finally, add in the shredded cheese, stir/gently whisk to blend and melt in, and then finish with the honey and a pinch of salt, according to your taste; serve the soup garnished with the cubed/chopped leftover turkey, extra cheese and a few cilantro leaves, along with additional yellow corn tortilla chips."
