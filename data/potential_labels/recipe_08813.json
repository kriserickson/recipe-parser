    "For the pork: Heat the oil in a heavy pan over medium heat. Add the shallot, garlic, and jalapeño - saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Turn the heat to high and add the pork and the fish sauce - stir fry for a few minutes until the pork is no longer pink. With the heat very high, add the sugar and water and stir once - then let the pork caramelize by not stirring it for about 1 minute. Repeat this process until the pork is nice and golden brown.",
    "For the salsa: Toss everything together in a medium bowl.",
    "For the tacos: Warm the tortillas quickly in a skillet with a little bit of oil. Arrange the pork between 6 tortillas and top with the salsa and the chili sauce."
