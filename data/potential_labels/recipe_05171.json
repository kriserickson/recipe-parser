    "Preheat the oven to 160ºC/325ºF/gas 3. Roughly chop the nuts and apricots, then place into a large bowl. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix together. Drizzle over the maple syrup and finely grate over the orange zest, then stir well to coat everything.",
    "Spread out over a large baking tray in an even layer – split it between two, if it's easier. Pop into the hot oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until turning golden, stirring every 10 minutes or so to stop it from catching. Bear in mind that the granola will harden up and go crunchy as it cools, so don't be tempted to cook it for too long. Leave to cool completely, then tip into airtight storage jars and use as and when you need it – it will keep quite happily for up to 4 weeks.",
    "Tricks & tips: Feel free to swap in whichever nuts, seeds and dried fruit you like."
