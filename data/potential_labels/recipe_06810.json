    "METHOD",
    "First prepare the tandoori chicken.",
    "Place the ginger, garlic and green chilli in a wet grinder and blend to a smooth paste.",
    "Mix the yogurt with the gram flour in a bowl to get rid of any lumps, until you have a thick paste.",
    "Add the ginger, garlic and chilli paste, the paprika, chilli powder, garam masala and coriander powder. Also mix in the ground cinnamon, saffron and salt.",
    "Stir well and tip in the chicken pieces and mix well, making sure to coat them in the thick marinade. Leave to marinate for a few hours or even overnight if you prefer.",
    "Soak wooden skewers in water. Preheat the grill to medium. Shake off the excess marinade and thread the chicken pieces onto the skewers and place them on a wire rack.",
    "Cook under the grill for 15-20 minutes. Turn the skewers every 5 minutes and baste with melted butter until the chicken juices run clear and the pieces are cooked through and slightly charred around the edges.",
    "To prepare the sauce, place a deep saucepan over a low heat and add the butter. When hot, add cardamom pods, cinnamon and cloves. Fry for 20 seconds, then add the onions and sauté for 5-7 minutes over a medium heat until they take on a light brown colour.",
    "Add the grated ginger and birds eye chillies. Fry for a further minute, add the chilli powder and garam masala, stir for 20 seconds and add the tomato puree. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.",
    "Now gradually add the double cream, stirring continuously to mix it with all the spices. Simmer and cook for 2 minutes.",
    "Stir in the honey and the fenugreek. Season to taste. Add the water as well.",
    "Add the cooked chicken pieces and simmer the curry on a low heat for 6-8 minutes.",
    "Garnish with coriander and serve with naan bread."
