    "To extract colour: In a saucepan, bring the water and bunga telang to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, covered, for 3-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow to steep for 10-15 minutes. Cool down slightly before use.",
    "To prepare rice layer: Divide the washed rice into three parts. Place two parts in a bowl and add enough water to cover the grains. Place the remaining part in another bowl and add the blue water – top up with water if necessary to submerge the grains. Set aside for 3-6 hours.",
    "Drain the rice and place in two steaming pans with the pandan leaves. Pour 2/3 of the coconut milk on the white rice, and the remainder on the blue rice. Mix well.",
    "Steam over high heat for 20 minutes.",
    "After steaming, combine the two rice to get a marbled look in a lightly greased 20cm (8”) pan and press down on the rice using your palms to compact it really well.",
    "Place the pan in the steamer. Turn on the heat to start the steam over medium-low flame.",
    "Wrap the lid of the steamer with kitchen towel to catch the water droplets which would otherwise form watermarks on the surface of the kuih.",
    "To prepare custard layer: In a blender, blitz the pandan leaves and water. Strain the mixture – you should get 100ml of concentrated pandan juice.",
    "In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar. Add the coconut milk, pandan juice, and flours. Stir until smooth.",
    "Strain the mixture into a heatproof bowl placed over a pan of simmering water. Stir continuously until mixture thickens into custard.",
    "Pour the custard carefully over the rice layer in the steamer. Steam over low heat until the custard layer sets – about 25-30 minutes.",
    "Leave the kuih to cool completely at room temperature – about 6 hours – before cutting.",
    "Note: 1. Colouring the rice is optional. 2. Do not use pandan leaves which are too big as they are not as fragrant."
