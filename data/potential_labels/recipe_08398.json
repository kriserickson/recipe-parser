    "Directions",
    "Set a large pot of water including one cup of shrimp stock to a boil and add the salt. Place the pasta in the pot and stir (to keep from sticking together) until the water returns to a boil. Cook until tender, reserve 1/2 cup pasta water.",
    "While the pasta cooks, heat a 12-inch sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the butter and olive oil to the pan. Once the butter has melted, season the shrimp with 1 tablespoon of creole seasoning and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and add the shrimp to the pan. Sear the shrimp just enough to brown on both sides, about 2 minutes, you want them almost done. Remove from the pan and set aside. I do this with most of my shrimp dishes. The shrimp flavor remains in the glaze from the sear, but you avoid overcooking the shrimp.",
    "Add the tasso and andouille cook until browned.",
    "Add the onions to the pan and sauté until the onions become clear and lightly caramelized. Add the garlic to the pan Slowly add the wine to deglaze the pot. Add the cream, remaining seasoning, salt and pepper to the pan and bring to a slight boil. Add the tomatoes and red pepper. Cook the sauce until the cream is reduced by half.",
    "Return the shrimp to the pan, and add pasta and the reserved cooking water to the pan and cook, tossing to incorporate for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pan from the heat and add cheese, parsley and basil and toss to blend. Serve immediately."
