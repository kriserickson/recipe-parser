    "Directions: Add coconut oil to a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Season chicken breasts with half of the salt and pepper, add chicken to sauté pan, and season the other side with remaining salt and pepper. Sear chicken for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until slightly golden brown. While chicken is searing, add garlic, Italian seasonings, and cinnamon to the honey. Stir and set aside.",
    "Place seared chicken in the slow cooker, pour honey mixture over the top, sprinkle on the pecans, and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or on high for 4 hours. Once cooked, remove chicken from crockpot, cover with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Once chicken has rested, shred chicken and add back to the sauce, or serve breasts whole with the sauce drizzled on top with a handful of fresh parsley."
