    "In an electric mixer or by hand, whisk together egg yolks and 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar until light, dense, and mixture forms a ribbon trail when whisk is lifted. While whisking, very slowly add 1 cup bourbon. Cover this mixture, and refrigerate for one hour.",
    "Whisk in remaining bourbon, then beat in cream and milk. Add 1/2 cup more milk if it is too thick. In another bowl, whisk egg whites with a pinch of salt, until fluffy. Slowly add remaining confectioners' sugar while whisking; keep whisking until whites are shiny and hold firm but not stiff peaks. Fold egg whites into egg yolk mixture.",
    "To serve, ladle eggnog into small cups -- demitasse cups would work well -- making sure to get some foam on each. Grate a little nutmeg on top of each."
