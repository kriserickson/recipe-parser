    "Preheat oven to 450 °F and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the bones on the baking sheet and roast for 40 minutes, flipping halfway through.",
    "Once the bones are cooked place bones in a large stockpot and cover with water. Add the vinegar and allow to sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.",
    "Roughly chop the vegetables and add to the stockpot. Bring to a rolling boil and then lower to a simmer.",
    "For the first 2-3 hours, skim any foamy layer that develops on the top and discard.",
    "For beef bone broth, simmer for 48 hours, for chicken bone broth, simmer for 24 hours, for fish broth, simmer for 8 hours.",
    "Allow to cool slightly and strain. Transfer the broth to an airtight container and refrigerate for 4-6 hours or overnight. This will allow the fat to rise to the top and solidify.",
    "Scrape the fat off the top with a spoon. This will leave you with a gelatinous bone broth when cold."
