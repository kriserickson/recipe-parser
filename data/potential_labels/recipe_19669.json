    "Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the macaroni and cook until just al dente.",
    "To make the sauce, put all the ingredients apart from the vegan cheese into a bowl or blender and whisk or blend until smooth. Tip into a large pan over a low–medium heat. Add 100g/3½oz vegan cheese and cook until melted – but be careful not to bring it to a simmer.",
    "Preheat the grill to medium–high. Drain the pasta, then add to the cheese sauce and mix until coated. Tip into a 30cm/12in oval baking dish and top with the remaining 20g/½oz vegan cheese. Grill for 5–10 minutes, or until golden.",
    "If making the topping, heat the oil in a heavy-based pan. Add the garlic, sprouts and a pinch of salt and fry for 5 minutes. Scatter the topping over the mac and cheese before serving."
