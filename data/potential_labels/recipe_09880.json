    "Preheat oven to 275ºF.",
    "Wash and scrub your sweet potatoes well, and them dry with a clean dish towel.",
    "If you have a mandolin, position it to 1/16 inch thickness, and slice sweet potatoes into rounds. If you don’t have a mandolin use a very sharp knife and cut rounds equally thin. It’s important to make sure the rounds are equally thin so that they crisp evenly in the oven.",
    "Using a basting brush, lightly brush each round with olive oil on each side and place on 2 baking sheets, making sure not to overlap the potatoes. Lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
    "Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, flipping halfway through.",
    "Allow the chips to sit for 10 minutes to allow them to crisp up."
