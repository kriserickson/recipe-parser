    "!Pomegranate Guacamole",
    "Add the avocado halves to a medium size mixing bowl. Squeeze the lime juice over the avocados and toss well to coat. Add the cumin. Now grab a fork and lightly mash the avocados. I like to keep my guacamole on the chunky side. Next fold in the chopped jalapeño, cilantro, pomegranate arils and a pinch of salt. Stir in the feta cheese (if using). Taste and season with more salt if desired. Grab some plantain chips (recipe below) and dig in!",
    "!Plantain Chips",
    "In a small bowl, combine the chili powder and salt.",
    "Heat an inch or so of oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot add the plantains and fry for 2-3 minutes per side or until just lightly golden. Remove and drain on paper towels. Now transfer the plantains to a cutting board and, using the back of a wooden spoon, smash them down into round flat disks.",
    "Return the plantains to the hot oil and fry another 2-3 minutes on each side or until they are golden and crispy. Remove to a paper towel lined plate and sprinkle with chili salt. Chips are best eaten right after frying, but any leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature."
