    "In a large heavy pot, heat coconut oil over medium heat. Add yellow onion and sweat onion 5–7 minutes until soft and translucent. (You do not want to brown the onions! It will ruin the color, so if you need to reduce the heat, do so).",
    "Add carrots, potato, stock, coconut milk, bay leaf, curry and cumin and then put a lid on the pot and reduce heat to low. Simmer soup for 40 minutes.",
    "Transfer soup in batches to the jar of a blender and puree until smooth, then transfer back to the pot and re-heat over medium heat. Season to taste with kosher salt and serve hot."
