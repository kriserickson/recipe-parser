    "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a deep sided frying pan. Saut√© the mushrooms on a high heat for several minutes until nicely browned. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mushrooms to a plate. Heat the remaining olive oil in the same pan and add the onion. Cook over a medium heat until softened. Add the garlic and sweet peppers and cook for a further 2 minutes.",

    "Season the chicken fillets on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Shift the vegetables to the side of the pan and brown the chicken on both sides. Deglaze the pan with the wine and reduce by half. Add the tomatoes, stock, chilli, lemon peel, sugar and herbs. Return the mushrooms to the pan, cover with a lid and simmer for about 20 minutes. Adjust seasoning if needed. Place the mozzarella on top and brown under a hot grill until the cheese is bubbling and golden."
