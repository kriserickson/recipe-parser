    "Note: The serving size is for melted chocolate, so if you measure out the pieces beforehand, allow more chips to be added than the recommended amount.",
    "Place a teaspoon of melted chocolate on parchment paper; top with a small handful of almonds. Drizzle almonds with one tablespoon melted chocolate. Repeat process with remaining almonds and chocolate until your pan is full.",
    "Sprinkle coconut shavings over each tiny delight.",
