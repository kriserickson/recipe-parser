    "Rinse the zucchini, remove the ends, then cut into ¼ to ½ inch thick medallions. Place the medallions in a bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with lemon pepper. Toss the zucchini until evenly coated in oil and seasoning.",
    "Preheat the grill (for a George Foreman, I turn it on for about 5 minutes to preheat). Cook the medallions until they are tender and lightly browned on each side (about 3-4 minutes per side). Serve warm."
