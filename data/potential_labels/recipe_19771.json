    "Step 1",
    "For lemon curd: In a medium saucepan combine zest and juice of three lemons, 1 cup sugar, eggs, egg yolks, butter, and pinch of salt. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium until mixture thickens and starts to bubble. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Strain through a fine mesh sieve. Transfer to a bowl. Cover surface with plastic wrap. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours or until chilled. (Lemon curd can be made a week ahead.)",
    "Step 2",
    "For syrup: In a small saucepan combine zest and juice of two lemons, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup water. Heat over medium just until sugar dissolves. Transfer to a small bowl; let cool.",
    "Step 3",
    "For mascarpone cream: In a small bowl beat cream with a mixer on medium until stiff peaks form. In a medium bowl beat mascarpone, 1/3 cup sugar, and zest of half lemon with the mixer until smooth. Fold in whipped cream.",
    "Step 4",
    "To assemble: Spoon one-third of the mascarpone cream into the bottom of eight glasses or ramekins (4- to 6-oz.). Dip ladyfinger halves into lemon syrup, coating both sides. Place about half of the ladyfingers in glasses, breaking or cutting cookies to fit. Top with one-half of the lemon curd and another third of mascarpone cream. Repeat cookie, curd, and cream layers. Cover each serving. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. If desired, top with sweetened whipped cream and additional zest. Serves 8.",
