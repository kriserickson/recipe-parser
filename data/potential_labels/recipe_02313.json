    "Place the peanuts and honey in a food processor, and process for 1 minute. Use a spatula to loosen mixture from the sides of the bowl if it’s sticking.",
    "Then continue to process while slowly drizzling oil into the mixture for another 2-3 minutes, or until the mixture is smooth, thick and shiny. (Nuts will go from a rough chop, to finely ground, to a thick paste, and then finally a shiny, smooth peanut butter.)",
    "Remove and store in an airtight container, and refrigerate. If mixture is too thick and cool when you’re ready to use it, simply place the container in a warm water bath, or pop your needed amount in the microwave to warm and soften it up.",
