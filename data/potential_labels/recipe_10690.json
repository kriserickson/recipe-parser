    "Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 300°F. Pour sugar into a 9- by 13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. Toast until the sugar turns ivory, about 1 hour. Stir well and continue roasting, now stirring once every 30 minutes, until darkened to light or sandy beige, 2 to 4 hours more depending on personal preference. Beyond that, the sugar will begin to liquefy.",
    "If you notice any liquid caramel around the edges, pour dry sugar into a stainless steel bowl. (The sticky caramel will remain stuck to the baking dish.) The sugar will be screaming-hot coming out of the oven, in excess of 212°F, so take care not to touch it. Set aside and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. If needed, grind the lumpy caramel in a food processor until powdery and fine. Transfer to an airtight container; store and use cup for cup or ounce for ounce in any recipe in place of plain sugar."
