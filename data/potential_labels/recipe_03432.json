    "Make Biscuits:.",
    "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450°F.",
    "Blend together flour and butter in a bowl with a pastry blender or your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. Stir in milk with a fork just until a sticky dough forms.",
    "Turn dough out onto a floured surface and gently knead 7 or 8 times, (Do not overwork, or biscuits will be tough).",
    "Pat dough into a 9- by 6-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface, then cut into 6 (3-inch) squares.",
    "Arrange squares 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet and bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.",
    "Cool to warm on baking sheet on a rack.",
    "Make Chicken In Gravy While Biscuits Bake:.",
    "Cook onion, carrot, celery, salt, and pepper in butter in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle flour over vegetables and cook, stirring, 1 minute.",
    "Stir in broth and thyme and bring to a boil, stirring, then boil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes.",
    "Add half-and-half and chicken to gravy and gently simmer until chicken is heated through, about 3 minutes.",
    "Stir in lemon juice.",
    "To Serve:.",
    "Halve biscuits and put each bottom half in a shallow bowl.",
    "Spoon chicken in gravy over biscuit bottoms and cover with biscuit tops.",
    "1",
    "Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.",
    "Put 1 Tbsp butter in a large cast iron skillet, or heavy baking dish, and place in oven.",
    "In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, 3/4 cup of the cheese, and salt, mix till combined.",
    "Cut butter in using a pastry cutter or two knives (I use my kitchen-aid, more often than not, with a paddle beater), until it is the consistency of small peas.",
    "Stir in buttermilk, if too dry or crumbly, add at few splashes more until the dough is workable, but not sticky.",
    "Take skillet out of the oven.",
    "On a floured surface, turn dough out, knead no more than 8-10 times, and pat down to about 3/4\" thickness. Cut out biscuits with a biscuit cutter or a kitchen glass. Don't bother re-rolling the dough, just leave the odds and ends in the pan as they are as a little treat for yourself. Just to ensure the biscuits aren't tough!",
    "Prick with the tines of a fork, and brush with beaten egg over the tops.",
    "Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of cheese, place in hot skillet.",
    "Bake 10-12 minutes till golden brown and cheese is bubbly and slightly browned."
