    "Preheat oven to 325ºF. Lightly oil mini donut pan and set aside (alternatively you can use an electric mini donut maker or mini muffin pans)",
    "In a medium bowl with a hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the egg, milk, and vanilla and mix until just combined (mixture will look curdled).",
    "Add in the baking powder and the salt and mix until just incorporated. Mix in the flour just until combined. You don’t want to over-mix this batter.",
    "If using mini donut pan, transfer mixture into a piping bag fitted with a large round tip or into a ziplock baggie with the tip cut off. Pipe into the pan only filling 1/2 of the way fill. If using the mini muffin pan, fill each well 1/2 full",
    "Bake at 325ºF for 8-10 minutes. *If using a mini donut maker, bake for 4-5 minutes. Allow to cool just slightly before dipping in topping.",
    "Melt the butter for the topping and combine the cinnamon and sugar. Dip each donut lightly in butter then roll in cinnamon and sugar."
