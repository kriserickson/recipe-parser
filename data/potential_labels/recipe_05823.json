    "Preheat oven to 210°C | 410°F. Prepare a shallow baking dish with half of the pasta sauce. Set aside. Using a mandolin, slice Zucchini lengthwise to create wide ribbons. Set aside.",
    "Place spinach in a large bowl and squeeze out any excess liquid and discard. Mix in the ricotta, eggs, garlic and ½ cup of the mozzarella cheese until all ingredients are well combined. Mix through salt to taste.",
    "Place two zucchini ribbons on top of each other (as pictured above); spoon 1-2 tablespoons of the ricotta mixture onto the smallest end. Roll up to form a cannelloni and place into a shallow baking dish, open end facing up. Repeat with remaining zucchini and spinach mixture. Pour the remaining sauce over the 'cannelloni,' and top with remaining cheese.",
    "Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbling and the zucchini is soft when tested with a fork or toothpick."
