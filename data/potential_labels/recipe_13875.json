    "Chop the chicken wings into three pieces, along the joints. Keep the 2 meatier sections for the baked wings. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over them. Set aside. (You can reserve the wing tips for making chicken stock or discard them.)",
    "Blend the marinade ingredients in a blender until smooth. Pour the marinade into a bowl. Add the chicken wings, and mix everything together. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.",
    "Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Place an oven-safe wire rack on top of the pan. Brush oil on the rack to prevent wings from sticking.",
    "Shake excess sauce from the wings, and place them on the rack. Save the marinade. Bake wings for 25 minutes.",
    "While the wings are baking, cook the leftover marinade in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Once it boils, reduce the heat to medium-low, and let it simmer for 8–10 minutes, until the sauce thickens. (You should see small bubbles in the sauce.) Turn off the heat, and use this as the basting sauce.",
    "After 25 minutes, baste the wings, flip them over and baste the other side.",
    "Bake for another 17 minutes. Baste wings again, flip and baste the other side.",
    "Bake for another 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, and remove the wings from the oven. Brush additional sauce on the wings.",
    "Let the wings rest for a few minutes before serving. Refrigerate leftovers for 4–5 days."
