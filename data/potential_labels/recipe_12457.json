    "Spread panko in a thin layer on rimmed baking sheet and bake for about 3 minutes in the middle rack, until light brown. Transfer the panko to a shallow dish and mix in the Parmesan and coarse salt. Drizzle the oil and mix well. Set out the flour and eggs in separate dishes. Increase the oven temperature to 450°F. Place a wire rack on the baking sheet, lightly coat with cooking spray.",
    "In small batches, coat the chicken in flour, shaking off any excess, dip in egg, and lastly coat well with panko. Transfer to the rack. Bake the chicken until desired tenderness, about 12-14 minutes, turning when halfway through. Serve nuggets with the Spicy Ketchup Dipping Sauce."
