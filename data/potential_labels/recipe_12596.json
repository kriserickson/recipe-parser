    "Scrub and wash the sweet potatoes, then slice into approx. 1 inch – 2.5cm thick slices. Place parchment paper on an oven proof sheet pan (tray) and arrange all the slices evenly. Bake for 30 min at 350°F – 180°C or until soft.",
    "In a mixing bowl, add the butter, melt in the microwave approx 20 seconds, or optionally melt using a saucepan. Grate and add the Parmesan cheese, add the garlic (minced or chopped finely), and finely chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper and mix well.",
    "Check that the potatoes are cooked by inserting a knife or skewer to check. It should be very soft. If cooked remove from oven and place on a heat resistant bench. Using a standard fork, squash each one until the centre mashes out.",
    "Using a spoon, scoop out a little mixture and top each one ensuring they are nicely covered.",
    "Return to oven or high heat or place under broiler (grill) until brown. Note the broiler may burn some parchment papers, so ideally if using broiler, remove the paper leaving potato sclices directly on sheet pan (tray) they won’t stick."
