    "Flavor Variation: You can really spice up this recipe by adding 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce to the picante sauce mixture.",
    "Chef Tip: Try this autumn-inspired version! Substitute 1 1/4 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes, for the bone-in pork chops. Marinate the pork in apple cider to cover for 6 to 8 hours. Brown the pork as directed in Step 2, then add 1/4 cup applejack (a type of apple brandy), stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. For Step 3, pour the picante sauce mixture over the pork and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 20 minutes or until the pork is fork-tender. Stir 1 tablespoon butter into the skillet before serving. Serve over buttered noodles with braised red cabbage on the side."
