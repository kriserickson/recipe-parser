    "Tip the flour into a bowl and mix in the\nyeast with the salt. Stir in the water, oil\nand honey. Now bring together to make a\nsoft dough – I use my hands, but a\nwooden spoon or knife from the cutlery\ndrawer is fine. Tip onto a lightly floured\nsurface and knead for 10 mins. It is worth\nputting in the time to do this as it will pay\noff later with lovely airy bread.",
    "Don’t keep adding flour, a wet dough\nis better than a dry one, which will bake\nto a tough texture, so if you don’t like the\ndough sticking to your hands, lightly oil\nthem. If you are adding flavourings,\nknead them in gently now.",
    "Turn the dough into an oiled 1kg bread\ntin and cover with oiled cling film (or\nbetter still, a free unused shower cap\nfrom your last hotel stay!). Put in a warm\nplace until the bread fills the tin, it should\ntake between 1-2 hrs.",
    "Uncover and bake your bread at\n200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 30-35 mins until\ngolden. Tip out of the tin and tap the base\nof the loaf. It should sound hollow when\nfully cooked. If not cooked, put loaf back\nin the oven out of the tin and test again\nafter 10 mins. Cool."
