    "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, prepare the following, adding them to a blender: finely grate the zest of 3 large lemons, then juice the lemons; finely grate 1 3/4 ounces Parmesan cheese (about 1 cup). Coarsely chop the leaves from 1/2 bunch fresh parsley and set aside for garnish, if using.",
    "Add 1 pound dried fettuccine to the boiling water and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes or according to package instructions. Meanwhile, add 1 1/2 cups Greek yogurt, 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to the blender. Blend on high speed until the Parmesan cheese is thoroughly incorporated and the sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes.",
    "When the fettucine is ready, drain and return it to the pot. Pour in the yogurt mixture and use tongs to thoroughly toss and incorporate the sauce. The sauce will be very thin at first but will thicken up once the cheese melts. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as needed. Serve warm, garnished with the chopped parsley, if desired."
