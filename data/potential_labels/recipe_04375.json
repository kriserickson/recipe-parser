    "In a dish sprinkle salt, pepper, garlic salt and seasoning salt all over, then take each slice of rib and rub both sides with the seasoning mixture. Make sure each rib is well coated.",
    "Line a baking dish with heavy duty foil and spray with pam, preheat oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Place ribs inside the baking dish and inside the oven for 20minutes until meat is browned on both sides. You can flip them over halfway.",
    "Take ribs out and brush on honey bbq sause on top of ribs genorously and put back in oven for another 20minutes until sause is caramelized. Once sause is caramelized add more sause to the top of the ribs.",
    "Cover the baking dish with foil well to make sure no steam can come out but try not to touch the top of the ribs. Make sure all sides are well sealed and put back into the oven.",
    "Turn oven down to 250 degrees so sause wont burn and let them bake for 2-3 hours. After two hours have passed, pull back a corner of the foil and poke one of the ribs with a fork to check tenderness of the meat, if you desire them to be even more tender put the tinfoil back over tightly and let them sit for another hour.",
    "After ribs are done peel back foil carefully as steam will come out, take out ribs cover with sause again and they are ready to be served!",

    "Brown the pork in a lightly sprayed skillet on all sides (apprx 7 minutes).",
    "Place the ribs in an oven proof pan and scatter the onions all around them.",
    "Pour in the beer and seal with a lid or tin foil.",
    "Bake at 375F until the pork is tender 1 1/2- 2 hours.",
    "Pour out the beer.",
    "Slather the pork with the BBQ sauce and bake uncovered for 1 more hour or until the meat is brown and the sauce is thick.",
    "Enjoy."
