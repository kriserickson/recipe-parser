    "Position a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, then arrange the bacon slices in a single layer on top. Bake until the bacon is golden brown and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping once halfway through. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to absorb any excess fat, cool and then cut each slice in half making 12 smaller strips.",
    "Meanwhile, from the top and 3 sides of the lettuce, slice 4 round \"cheeks\" 4 to 5 inches across to make 2 \"buns\".",
    "Whisk the yogurt, mayonnaise, chives, lemon juice and zest, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper together in a small bowl.",
    "Assemble the sandwiches: On a work surface, lay the lettuce \"buns\" cut side up and spread 1 tablespoon lemon-pepper sauce on each side. Lay six strips of bacon on each bottom bun and top with two slices of tomato. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and sandwich with remaining lettuce buns.",
