    "Pop the popcorn and pour into a large bowl. I used microwave (the ‚Äúextra butter‚Äù variety but you could use air popped or whatever is your favorite! Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or wax paper. Spread the popcorn out on the cookie sheet.",
    "Sprinkle the M&M‚Äôs and pretzels evenly over the popcorn. Melt white chocolate and pour over the popcorn mix. I do this by chopping up the almond bark, then putting it in a microwave-safe measuring cup and microwaving for 1 minute. Stir and microwave again ‚Äì in 30 second intervals until smooth and completely melted.",
    "Pour it over the popcorn, then gently stir it up to coat the popcorn. Sprinkle with Christmas sprinkles to make it extra festive!! üôÇ Let it dry/harden, then break it up and enjoy!",
    "PS. If you want to speed up the drying/hardening, pop it in the frig or freezer for a couple of minutes!"
