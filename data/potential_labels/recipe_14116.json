    "In a medium bowl, combine bananas, oil, syrup, and vanilla. In a separate medium bowl, combine oats, flour, baking soda, coconut and salt. Add the banana mixture to the dry ingredients and blend until just combined (do not overmix). Fold in the chocolate chips.",
    "Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and drop batter by heaping teaspoons onto the sheet [she doesn’t specify how far apart; I’d say about one inch or5 cm]. There is no need to roll, flatten or shape the mounds [here’s where I had trouble: I would actually flatten them slightly next time.] Place in oven and bake 14 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from oven and place directly n a wire rack to cool. Makes 1-1/2 dozen cookies."
