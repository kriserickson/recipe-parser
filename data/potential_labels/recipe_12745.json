    "Finely grate the cheese and mix with the dried mint. Chop a handful of the mint leaves and set aside. In the meantime, cook the pasta in the chicken stock. If you don’t have ready made stock, use three chicken stock cubes in around 2 litres of water. The liquid should cover the pasta by an inch or so",
    "2",
    "If the liquid gets too low before the pasta is cooked, add a splash more. You want most of the liquid to have been absorbed by the end, but with some still remaining",

    "Layer some of the grated cheese and mint in an empty shallow bowl per person. When the pasta is al dente, ladle half a portion into the bowl along with a little of the stock",
    "4",
    "Sprinkle another layer of the grated cheese, top with some more pasta and finish with the final layer of cheese. Sprinkle with a generous amount of the fresh mint. Squeeze the juice from ¼ to ½ a lemon over each bowl (depending on how much your guests like lemon – I like it a lot), and serve with a few more wedges if needed"
