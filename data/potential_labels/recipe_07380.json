    "Place all the ingredients except water in a high power blender and blend until smooth. Add the water, a tablespoon at the time until the filling become silky and you get your desired texture. Transfer the filling to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and chill overnight. To make the cake, preheat oven to 350°F. Line two 8 inch spring-form pans with parchment paper. In a large bowl cream the eggs with honey. Add the coconut flour mixed with baking powder and seeds from vanilla pod and mix until combined. Divide the mixture between prepared pans and bake for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted. Remove cakes from the oven and set aside to cool completely.",
    "Remove the cakes from the pans and take the filling from the fridge. Whip the filling with a hand mixer until filling become fluffy. Place one of the cakes on a platter and spread 1/3 of filling evenly. Top with another cake and spread top and sides of cake with remaining filling. Sprinkle with sliced almonds if using and place in a fridge for minimum two hours before serving."
