    "When it is cooled, add the shredded Taleggio, the grated Grana Padano, and the ground fennel, and toss well. Arrange the sliced bread on a baking sheet, and top with the sausage mixture. Top that with the sliced Taleggio. Bake until edges of the bread are toasted and the cheese is browned, about 7 minutes.",
