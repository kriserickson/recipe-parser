    "While the caramel is melting, mix together the cake mix and the cinnamon until fully combined. Then add the melted butter, the vanilla and the remaining 1/3 cup evaporated milk. Divide the mixture in two.",
    "Spread half of the cake mixture over the bottom of the 9 by 13 pan. Bake for eight minutes.",
    "Remove the pan from the oven, very carefully spread the apples over the cake mix. I did this by dropping big chunks of apple on the cake and then pouring the liquid from the filling over the top. If you try to just dump the whole can on the cake, it will be a big mess.",
    "Pour the caramel over the apples and then top with clumps of the remaining cake mix. Bake for 20 to 25 more minutes or until the caramel at the edge begins to bubble and the cake at the edge begins to brown. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
