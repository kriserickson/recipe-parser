    "Combine the coconut milk, coconut sugar, salt and vanilla bean in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the quinoa and stir. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot slightly, and cook for about 30 minutes stirring every few minutes. If skin starts to form on top of the milk, just stir it back in. The milk will reduce and thicken. Once the quinoa is cooked and the milk has thickened add the vanilla extract. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Ladle into bowls or jars or store in the fridge if you prefer to eat cold.Add the raspberries to a bowl and gently toss them with the honey.Sprinkle each serving of pudding with toasted coconut and toasted slivered almonds. Add the raspberries. Enjoy warm or cold!"
