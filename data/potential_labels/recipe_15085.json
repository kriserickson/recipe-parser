    "Make the dressing by mixing all ingredients in a small bowl. Preheat oven to 180°C.",
    "Slice the onion finely and the red cabbage in 0,5cm to 1cm thick slices. Arrange them in a baking tray lined with a baking sheet. Spread the thyme sprigs and the dressing over everything and bake for 15 minutes.",
    "In the meantime, thinly slice the pears. After 15 min., remove from the oven, turn over the cabbage, add pear slices and sprinkle with a few drops of maple syrup. Top with the goat cheese (or walnuts) and return to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "Serve with a few drops of freshly squeezed lemon juice and fresh thyme."
