    "Method",
    "Preheat the oven to gas mark 7, 425F.",
    "Grease and flour baking tray.",
    "Mix flour and salt in a large bowl.",
    "Rub in butter/margarine using fingertips.",
    "Stir in caster sugar and then make a well in the centre.",
    "Whisk eggs lightly and stir in with a wooden spoon, mix in the milk.",
    "On a floured board, knead the mixture and divide into 12 pieces.",
    "Shape each one into a round bun and place on the prepared baking tray.",
    "Make a hollow in the centre by gently pushing your thumb into the centre and then put the jam in the middle.",
    "Bake for 10-12 mins, until well risen and brown. Cool on a wire rack.",
    "Handy Hint",
    "I have never measured out the jam I use about a teaspoon in each bun. Other Variations: Use other jams such as apricot, gooseberry, blackcurrant, Cherry, Strawberry or worth trying any jam. You can try flavour bun mixture by adding 1 tsp granted lemon rind or a large pinch cinnamon, or mixed spice. Use lemon or orange curd instead of jam."
