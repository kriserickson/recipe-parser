    "HOW TO MAKE IT",
    "Combine all sauce ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.",
    "Pour into a medium sauce pan, bring to a boil and allow to simmer for at least 20 minutes.",
    "Heat oil in a medium skillet until it shimmers. Dip tortillas, one at a time, into the oil to soften and lightly fry, about 45 seconds to a minute. Then dip the softened tortilla into the enchilada sauce and remove to a plate.",
    "Add crumbled Queso Fresco to the middle of the tortilla and top with a few slices of pepper (optional). Roll tortilla around the filling to make the enchilada. To serve, top enchiladas with lettuce, queso fresco crumbles, and drizzle with chipotle crema.",
    "Chipotle Crema: In a bowl, combine the Crema Mexicana, chipotle chile, and salt. With an immersion blender (or regular blender), mix until smooth, approximately 20 seconds. Refrigerate until ready to use and place in a squeeze bottle. Yields: approximately 1 cup"
