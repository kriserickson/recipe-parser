    "Separate the broad beans into 2 piles – big and small. Drop the big ones into boiling water for 1 minute and then put them aside to cool down. Pop them out of their shells when they're cool enough to handle.",
    "Roughly mash the blanched broad beans – you can do this with a food processor, chop them up with a knife or crush them in a pestle and mortar. Mix together with the small raw beans, the pecorino, lemon juice, oil and some of the mint, finely chopped.",
    "Season to taste, then serve with the torn ham, a final zesting of lemon and the rest of the mint ripped up and scattered over the top."
