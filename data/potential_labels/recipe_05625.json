    "Blanch the runner beans in plenty of boiling salted water for 2 minutes, then drain well. Refresh in cold water and drain again. Chop them finely and set aside.",
    "Put the onions in a large, heavy-based pan with half the vinegar and simmer for 20 minutes, then add the beans.",
    "Mix the cornflour, mustard powder, turmeric, mustard seeds and sesame seeds with a little of the remaining vinegar and then stir them into the onion and bean mix.",
    "Add the rest of the vinegar and cook gently for 10 minutes. Add both the sugars and stir until dissolved.",
    "Bring back to the boil, stirring constantly, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for about 1 hour until slightly thickened, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.",
    "Transfer to warm sterilised jars, seal and allow to mature for 6–8 weeks."
