    "Slice the baguette. You should get at least 12 pieces out of it. Throw them in a toaster and toast until golden brown.",
    "Meanwhile, rinse and cut the cucumber into 12 thin slices. Place roasted peppers onto a paper kitchen towel to get rid of the excess liquid. You can do the same with anchovies.",
    "When baguette slices are toasted, start assembling the bites: start with a baguette slice, spread a thin layer of mayonnaise, then add a slice of cucumber, roasted peppers, and 1/2 to 1 small anchovy.",
    "Arrange on a serving plate and serve.",
    "Note: This will yield 12 pieces."
