    "Finely chop the onion and garlic and saute in a frying pan in a good glug of olive oil until soft and fragrant.",
    "Dice the red pepper and chorizo into chickpea-sized chunks and add to the pan with the chickpeas and paprika.",
    "Saute everything together until the orangy paprika oils run from the chorizo.",
    "Add the spinach and keep stirring until it wilts and everything starts to meld together in the pan.",
    "Add the eggs and stir gently to incorporate the eggs into the whole mixture, then allow to set over a medium heat.",
    "Preheat the grill then slide the whole pan under the grill to set the top of the fritatta, it will only take a minute or two to become light gold and puffy.",
    "Remove from the grill, gently loosen from the edge of the frying pan with a knife then place a large plate over the pan and invert the fritatta onto it. Then place another plate on top and invert once again so the glossy grilled top of the fritatta is on view.",
    "Sprinkle with a little sea salt.",
    "Allow to cool slightly before slicing into canape sized cubes or wedges. Serve hot or room temperature as a tapas or with a salad."
