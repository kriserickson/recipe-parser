    "Grate the zucchini and carrots using the large holes on a box grater. Thinly slice the onions, mince the garlic, and roughly chop parsley.",
    "Prepare one recipe of your favorite homemade or store-bought pancake mix, but use 1/4 cup less liquid than called for; the zucchini will add a great deal of liquid to the mix. Fold the vegetables into the prepared pancake batter.",
    "Warm a skillet over medium-high heat and brush it gently with olive oil. Use a 1/3 measuring cup to scoop the batter onto the warmed skillet. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, until the outer edges have set, then flip. Cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes and remove from heat.",
    "Sprinkle the pancakes liberally with salt and allow to cool slightly before serving. Serve with butter, sour cream, or even a savory jam or chutney if you have it!"
