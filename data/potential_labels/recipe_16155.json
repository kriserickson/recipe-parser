  "title": "Bulgur-Tomato Pilaf with Herbs and Pomegranate Molasses (Eetch)\nStart to ?nish: 30 minutes Servings: 4 This Armenian bulgur salad, known as eetch, is heartier and more substantial than tabbouleh. Instead of soaking bulgur in water—as is done for tabbouleh—it is hydrated in a mix of tomato paste and water, giving the grains a red-orange hue. For a more tart-tangy ?avor, mix in a splash of lemon juice. To make this a full meal, add blanched green beans and crumbled feta cheese, then top with fried eggs. Don't use ?ne or medium bulgur. These varieties have di?erent liquid-absorption rates than coarse bulgur, the type called for in this recipe. They also don't have the same hearty chew.",

    "In a small bowl, whisk together 1?cups water and the tomato paste. Set aside. In a 10-inch skillet over medium, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the bell pepper, chopped scallions and ½ teaspoon salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pepper is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, cumin and Aleppo pepper, then cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.",
    "Stir in the bulgur, the tomato paste mixture and 1¼ teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high. Cover, reduce to low and simmer until the bulgur has absorbed the liquid, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.",
    "Transfer the bulgur to a wide, shallow bowl and let cool until warm, about 5 minutes. Drizzle the pomegranate molasses over the bulgur, then fold until combined. Fold in the tomatoes, mint and the sliced scallions. Taste and season with salt, pepper and additional molasses."
