    "Combine almond milk and lemon juice or vinegar in a medium-size mixing bowl and let set for 5 minutes.",
    "Then add yogurt, coconut oil, vanilla extract, maple syrup and whisk thoroughly to combine. Set aside. (If coconut oil hardens, reheat in the microwave. If you don't have a microwave, simply proceed as instructed.)",
    "Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk until well combined.",
    "Add wet ingredients to dry and mix until well incorporated. Let set for 10 minutes while your waffle iron preheats. (I set mine to 4 out of 5 for a crispier waffle, but adjust yours according to preference.)",
    "Once waffle iron is ready, generously coat with non-stick spray or coconut oil and pour on about 1/2 cup of batter. Cook according to manufacturer instructions and then remove and place on a cooling rack set on a baking sheet in a 200-degree F (93 C) oven to keep warm (optional). Do not stack and instead keep them in a single layer to ensure crispiness.",
    "Serve immediately with desired toppings. Store leftovers in a freezer safe bag and reheat in the toaster for best results. Will keep in the freezer for up to 1 month, although they're freshest within the first couple of weeks."
