    "In a large bowl, combine pumpkin, eggs, vegetable oil, applesauce, milk, vanilla extract and sugar.",
    "In a separate bowl, sift flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger together.",
    "Combine the 1st and 2nd bowl and stir only until combined.",
    "Stir in chocolate chips.",
    "Filling: Beat cream cheese, sugar, egg and milk together until smooth.",
    "For Loaf Pans: Pour a little bit of batter into the loaf pan, spread to cover the bottom and then spoon cream cheese filling and spread it on top. Continue to alternate until your pan is 3/4 full and then bake for 60-80 minutes or until an inserted knife comes out clean.",
    "For muffins: Fill each muffin tin 1/3 full, then spoon your filling in the pan, then top with another spoonful of pumpkin batter. Bake for 14-18 minutes or until an inserted knife comes out clean.",
    "NOTE: I sprinkled extra chocolate chips on top of my bread before baking to make it look extra pretty :)"
