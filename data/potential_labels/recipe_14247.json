    "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.",
    "Combine Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, the sugar, and salt in a medium bowl using a whisk. Using a bowl scraper or your fingers, mix in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal; using your fingers will create a more cake-like texture. Add the green apples, the cheese and the onions, stir to combine. Make a well in the center and pour in 1 1/4 cups of buttermilk. Stir until just combined. If the dough looks dry add the remaining buttermilk.",
    "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead 6-7 times. Pat the dough into a 1 1/2 -inch-thick disc and cut out biscuits using a 3-inch biscuit cutter. (Make sure you don't twist the cutter otherwise you'll squish the sides and the biscuit won't rise evenly.) Knead the scraps together, re-roll and cut out biscuits until all the dough has been used.",
    "Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. (If your biscuits touch slightly they will rise more but look less uniform). Bake until golden brown, 20 to 23 minutes."
