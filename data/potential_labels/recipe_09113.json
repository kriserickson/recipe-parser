    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.",
    "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Pat chicken breasts dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper. Sear chicken breasts, skin-side down, for 4 to 5 minutes to create a nice, golden crust. Flip chicken breasts and add garlic, lemons, and rosemary to pan (place in oil so they can crisp up a bit as well). Cook for another 3 minutes.",
    "Add chicken stock and place skillet in the oven. Roast for 15 to 18 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers a 165 degree F internal temperature at deepest part of breast. Remove from oven and let sit for 5 minutes.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice and remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. In a large bowl, toss together Brussels sprouts, lemon vinaigrette, and Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Serve chicken with roasted lemons, garlic, and rosemary and Brussels sprout slaw."
