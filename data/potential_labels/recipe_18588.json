    "Add coconut oil and tofu to a non-stick pan on medium heat. Try to not flip the tofu too soon, as it'll break apart this way. Just let it sit, and when the tofu \"let's go\" of the pan on it's own with a gentle push of your spatula, then you can flip it.",
    "Meanwhile, to a large pot on high heat, add oil, garlic and ginger. Let cook for 2 minutes, adding a splash of water as needed to deglaze the pan. Then add red curry paste and cook for 1 min more, stirring throughout. All the while, flipping the tofu as needed. When tofu is cooked to your liking, set aside.",
    "To the large pot, add the bouillon cubes, boiling water, coconut milk, bell pepper, soy sauce and sambal, partially cover and let simmer for 5 minutes, then add the noodles and Asian greens and let simmer for 3 more minutes. Add in the tofu, serve, garnish. Enjoy!"
