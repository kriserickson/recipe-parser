    "Add the millet to a medium saucepan and toast it over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the millet becomes fragrant and golden (about 5 minutes). The goal is a light toast, so be careful not to burn it.",
    "Add the coconut milk, coconut nectar, vanilla bean paste, almond extract, cinnamon, and sea salt to the saucepan. Stir to combine, turn the heat up to high, and bring the mixture to a boil.",
    "Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring every few minutes, until the millet is almost cooked through. Remove the saucepan from the heat and allow it to sit, covered, for 10 minutes.",
    "Serve warm with a small handful each of chopped almonds and fresh berries."
