    "Put garlic into mixer bowl, chop for 3 sec/speed 9/MC on. Scrape bowl down.",
    "Insert butterfly, add yolk, mustard, lemon, honey, salt and pepper to mixer bowl. Mix for 1 min/37°C or 100°F/speed 4/MC on.",
    "Set mixer to 3 mins/37°C or 100°F/speed 4 and VERY slowly start drizzling oil into bowl. Take the full 3 minutes to do so. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Scrape bowl out and set aside.",
    "Chipotle Chip Recipe",
    "Soak sliced potatoes in cold water for 10 mins. Drain well.",
    "Put potatoes into mixer bowl, cover with cold water and a pinch of salt, cook for 10 min/100°C or 212°F/slowest speed/reverse/MC on. Allow to cool to warm.",
    "In a bowl, coat potatoes with the oil and then cook in the airfryer for 20 min/200°C or 400°F, giving them the occasional shake. You can also bake them in a very hot oven for 30-40 mins.",
    "Put the salt, chipotle and paprika into a large bowl and when the chips are cooked, chuck them in there and give them a good coating. Serve with the aioli for a really delicious snack."
