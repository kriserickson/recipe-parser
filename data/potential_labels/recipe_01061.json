    "Get the kids to dip each turkey steak\ninto the flour, shaking off any excess,\nthen into the egg, and finally into the\nbreadcrumbs – press the crumbs into\nthe turkey to make sure they really stick.\nPut the steaks on a large baking tray,\ndrizzle with oil and bake for 20 mins.\nAdd the cherry tomatoes to the tray\nand bake for a further 5 mins.",
    "Meanwhile, boil a pan of water, then\nadd the broccoli and cook for 5 mins.\nAdd the butter beans and cook for 2 mins\nmore until broccoli is really tender. Drain\nwell and leave to steam-dry for 1-2 mins.\nTip back into the pan, add the pesto and\nget the kids to mash everything up with\na potato masher. Divide the turkey smash\nand tomatoes between plates – adding\nlemon wedges for those who want to\nsqueeze some over."
