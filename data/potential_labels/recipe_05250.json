    "Start by rinsing and draining your chickpeas, then place them on a baking tray in a 200C oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, until they start to firm up but aren’t crunchy.",
    "While the chickpeas cook prepare the rest of the salad. Chop coriander leaves and sun-dried tomatoes into small pieces, then chop the cucumber into quarters length-ways before slicing out the seedy middle of each quarter and then chopping the harder part into thin slices.",
    "Add the cucumber slices, coriander and sun-dried tomatoes to a big salad bowl with the rocket and artichokes.",
    "Place the pine nuts into a frying pan and sauté them for a couple of minutes until they start to go a golden brown – you don’t need to add any oil as they have plenty of their own. Once they’re deliciously brown add them to your salad too.",
    "To make your dressing simply squeeze the juice from the lemons and mix it in a mug with the olive oil, honey, paprika, cumin, salt and pepper and then drizzle it over the salad.",
    "Once the chickpeas are finished cooking, leave them to cool for a few minutes and then toss them into the salad with everything else, serve and enjoy!"
