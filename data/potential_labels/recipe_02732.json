    "In a small saucepan, heat the coconut milk through and including the salt over medium-low. Whisk to combine. Do not allow to boil.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables and coat a large 9×13 inch baking dish with a nonstick cooking spray. Preheat oven to 400 F.",
    "Ladle some of the sauce into the prepared dish, so it covers the bottom. Place one sliced potato in the dish, arranging the slices evenly among the bottom. Add half of the sliced onion, one of the chopped kale leaves, and four minced olives evenly over the first layer of potato.",
    "Repeat with second layer, excluding the sauce. Repeat with third layer (there will be no onion in this top layer).",
