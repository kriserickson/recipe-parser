    "Preheat the oven to 350F. -If using old-fashioned oats, grind them together in a food processor until it resembles coarse flour. -Combine everything in a large bowl until everything mixes well. -Grease the baking sheet lined with parchment paper (or use cooking spray) with coconut oil and drop the batter into the sheet using a large spoon (about a tablespoon). Flatten it a little bit using the back of the spoon. -Bake it for 12-15 minutes. -Remove from the oven and let it cool down before eating. I kept mine inside a refrigerator and it taste amazing even after two days. The recipe is just a guideline but you can swap any other nuts and seeds of your choice and even add dried fruits. Happy Wednesday!"
