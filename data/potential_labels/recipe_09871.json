    "Put the chopped peppers, onions, garlic, chicken, cajun seasoning, Red Hot, and bay leafs in the crockpot with the chicken stock. As you can see, I grabbed a container of my homemade stock directly from the freezer and threw it in. Set on low for 6 hours.",
    "About 30 minutes before it’s finished, toss in the cut up sausages.",
    "While this is cooking quickly make cauliflower rice by pulsing raw cauliflower in the food processor until it resembles rice.",
    "For the last 20 minutes, add in the cauliflower rice and the raw shrimp. Note: You can choose to quickly steam the cauliflower rice in the microwave and serve the jambalaya OVER it as well.",
    "Enjoy clear sinuses!!"
