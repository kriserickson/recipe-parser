    "Preheat the oven to 350 F. Mix up the nuts in a medium mixing bowl.",
    "In a separate small bowl, mix the olive oil with the seasonings.",
    "Pour the oil mixture over the nut mixture and stir to coat all the nuts.",
    "Spread the nuts out onto a rimmed baking sheet. A 11 x 15 jellyroll pan works really well for this.",
    "Bake for 10 - 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes, until the nuts are lightly browned and fragrant. Let cool and store in an airtight container."

  "ingredients": [
    "0",
    "5 cups assorted unsalted, raw mixed nuts and/or seeds (I used almonds, pecans, cashews, & pepitas)",
    "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil (I think you could cut the amount of olive oil in half and the nuts would still be lovely.)",
    "1 Tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped",
    "3 teaspoons flaky sea salt",
    "1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper",
    "1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic",
    "1/4 teaspoon Italian Seasoning"
