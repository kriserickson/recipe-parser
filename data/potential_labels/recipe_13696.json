    "Lay out zucchini slices on a cooling rack over a baking sheet, or in a large colander over a bowl (or in the sink). Salt the slices liberally and set aside for 20 minutes. The salt will draw out moisture from the slices and make them much easier to roll up.",
    "In the meantime, make the filling.",
    "In a food processor or blender, pulse the cashews, miso, salt, and nutritional yeast until very finely ground but not completely pureed.",
    "Add in the tofu, spinach, basil, and garlic, and pulse until fully combined and the mixture is homogenized (no large pieces or tofu or spinach visible).",
    "Preheat oven to 350F.",
    "Drain off any excess water from the zucchini and lay the slices out on a clean kitchen towel.",
    "Spread about 1 tablespoon of filling on each slice and roll up.",
    "Pour marinara sauce into a 2-quart casserole dish (8x8 baking pan or similar), and add the roll-ups in a single layer, spiral side facing up.",
    "Bake for 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees until warmed through."
