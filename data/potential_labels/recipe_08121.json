    "For the bowl:",
    "– Black Bean & Quinoa Salad (I made it with roasted sweet potato instead of carrots – loved this variation so much!)",
    "– 1-2 cups chopped roasted cauliflower",
    "– 1 sweet potato, sliced into rounds and roasted",
    "– hummus, as needed to get your daily quota (the salad is so good mixed with some hummus, FYI)",
    "– hemp hearts, for garnish (adds more protein and healthy fats…and let’s not forget edible confetti)"
