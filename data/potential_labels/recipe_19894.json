    "Combine the pasta, broth and salt in the rice cooker. Close the lid and cook for about 15 minutes (or until your rice cooker's regular cooking cycle completes), opening it quickly just to stir once or twice and make sure the pasta is not getting scorched on the bottom. The broth should be almost or completely absorbed.",
    "Meanwhile, if you're adding vegetables, prep them as needed.",
    "Once the pasta has cooked, open the lid to stir in the milk, cheese and any add-ins you like; reserve a little of the cheese to sprinkle on the surface. Close the lid and cook for about 10 minutes (or the length of a short cycle on your rice cooker). The cheese should be melted, and the milk should be well incorporated. Feel free to open the lid once or twice to make sure the mixture isn't scorching on the bottom."
