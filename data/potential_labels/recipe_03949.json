    "1Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti, stir to separate, and cook until al dente. Drain immediately.",
    "2Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set it aside. Add the onions to the drippings in the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper flakes, and saut√© about 30 seconds. Stir in the wine and tomatoes (and their juices), raise the heat, and cook at a lively simmer until the sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked bacon. Add the salt and freshly ground black pepper. Gently combine the spaghetti with the sauce, and serve topped with the basil and a generous grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese."
