    "In a medium bowl, mix the tahini, lemon juice, and garlic powder. Whisk until well combined. The dressing will be on the thicker side. If it’s really too thick, like a pasta, whisk in a bit of water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until it thins a bit.",
    "Add the tuna to the dressing and mix gently until it’s well coated. If needed, add sea salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Spoon the tuna on top of the veggies.",
    "If you want to be fancy, serve with some Za’atar seasoning or a bit of preserved lemon."
