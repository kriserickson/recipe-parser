    "In a small bowl combine the onions, celery, bell peppers, butter and seasonings, mix well.",
    "Place roast in a large roasing pan, fat side up. With a large knife make 6 to 12 deep slits in the meat (to form pockets) down to a depth of about 1/2 inch from the bottom; do not cut all the way through. Fill the pockets to their depths with the vegetable mixture, reserving about 1 tablespoon of the vegetables to rub over the top of the roast.",
    "Bake uncovered at 300F (150C / gas mark 2) until a meat thermometer reads about 160F for medium doneness, about 3 hours. For rarer roast, cook until thermometer reads 140F. Serve immediately topped with some of the pan drippings if you like.",
