    "Step 1 Put the spring onions and ginger in a large bowl and toss with the salt. Heat the oil in a small pan to 170C or until a cube of bread browns in 1 minute. Carefully pour the oil over the onions – it might spit a little, so stand back. Leave to cool, then stir in the rice vinegar.",
    "Step 2 Put the chicken breasts in a pan large enough to fit in one layer. Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes then take off the heat and leave to sit for 10 minutes with a lid on.",
    "Step 3 Toss the cucumbers in a bowl with a good pinch of sea salt and leave to sit.",
    "Step 4 Measure a standard mug of basmati rice into a pan then add 2 mugfuls of stock from the chicken pan and bring to a simmer. Put on a lid, turn right down and cook for 12-13 minutes or until the stock is absorbed. Fluff up the rice, divide between 4 plates then add slices of the chicken, a couple of spoonfuls of ginger sauce each and some salted cucumber. Drizzle with a little sesame oil to finish, if you like."
