    "Cook macaroni in boiling water until al dente. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, add mayo, milk, vinegar, with all spices, sugar, and seasoning salt, and whisk until combined. When macaroni is cooked, dump into colander to drain and run under cold water. Then add macaroni to the sauce, and incorporate vegetables. At this point, the sauce is pretty liquid. This is why youâ€™ll need to chill the mac salad in a fridge for several hours, preferably overnight. The macaroni will absorb much of the sauce. When ready to serve, mix well, and scoop onto plate."
