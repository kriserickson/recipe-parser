    "Preheat the oven to 350. Line 2 standard muffin tins with parchment muffin liners (enough for 18 muffins). Set aside.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the oat flour, garbanzo bean flour, sunflower seed meal, sorghum flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and salt.",
    "In a separate medium mixing bowl, combine the chia seeds, apple sauce, maple syrup, ½ cup olive oil, vanilla, and vinegar. Stir everything together. Set aside for 15 minutes to allow the chia to expand and become gelatinous within the mixture.",
    "Melt the chocolate together with the coffee and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. You can either do this in the microwave in 10 second increments until your chocolate liquifies. Or you can do this on the stovetop in a sauce pan, carefully stirring and cutting off the heat as soon as the chocolate mixture is warmer than body temperature to the touch -- stir everything together evenly to combine.",
    "Add the wet chia mix to the dry flour mix and fold the ingredients together. Add the chocolate, folding it into the mix until it's evenly spread throughout.",
    "Fill each parchment muffin liner ¾ of the way full with batter.",
    "Bake for 25 minutes. Remove and let cool at least 5 minutes before digging in.",
    "Serve with coffee or a glass of cold nut milk. Enjoy!"
