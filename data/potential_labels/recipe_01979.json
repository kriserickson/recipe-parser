    "Add the chicken (and optional pork) to the hot Dutch oven filled with enough water to completely cover meat. Place the lid over the top and check occasionally. When the chicken is white and cooked through (DO NOT OVERCOOK), drain ALL the water from the oven and add the sausage and BBQ sauce (add enough to completely drench the meat) Cook another 10-15 minutes, covered. Remove from heat, serve, and enjoy!"
