    "Cook pasta in a large generously-salted stockpot of boiling water al dente according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.",
    "While the pasta water is heating, melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute for 4-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it is fragrant and just barely starts to brown.",
    "Slowly add in the white wine, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked and ready to go. Taste, and season with extra salt and/or pepper and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.",
    "Once the pasta is cooked and drained, return it to the stockpot and add in the garlic-butter mixture. Toss until combined.",
    "Serve immediately, garnished with extra toppings if desired."
