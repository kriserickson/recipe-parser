    "hop 10-15 small yellow potatoes in half, and place on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, and spray with cooking oil. Bake at 400˚F/200˚C for 40 minutes, or until soft. Scoop out a small section of the potatoes to create a bowl. (You can add these to the hummus center, or simply snack on them now!)",
