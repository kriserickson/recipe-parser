    "In a small bowl, whisk 1 cup reduced-sodium beef broth, 3 tbsp each reduced-sodium soy sauce and ketchup, 1 tbsp each rice vinegar and cornstarch and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Set aside. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add 1 large head broccoli, cut into florets, return to a boil and cook 3 minutes. Scoop out broccoli with a slotted spoon and reserve. In same pot, cook 1/2 lb whole-grain linguine (such as Barilla) for 6 minutes; drain and set aside. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tbsp canola oil over medium-high. Add 1/2 lb flank steak, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices, and 1 large green bell pepper, cored, seeded and thinly sliced; stir-fry 3 minutes. Stir in sauce and simmer 1 minute, until thickened. Add broccoli and 1 can (8 oz) chopped water chestnuts, drained; cook 2 minutes. Toss with pasta and serve immediately.",
