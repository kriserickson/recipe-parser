    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
    "Make narrow incisions in the brisket and insert garlic cloves. Lay the brisket, fat side up, in a large roasting pan. Make sure the pan is large enough to hold all of the liquids. Pour the wine and water into the pan over the brisket. Season with salt and pepper and evenly distribute the onions. Cover the pan with foil and put in oven for 4 1/2 hours. (Time is based on a 1 1/2 hour to 1 pound ratio). Remove the pan from the oven to a cutting board. Slice the brisket and serve in flour tortillas with your favorite salsa.",
