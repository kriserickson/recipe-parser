    "In a blender or food processor, combine red pepper, mayo, and tofu and blend until smooth. Lay a sheet of nori onto your sushi mat and spread rice over the nori, leaving an inch or two on one side uncovered. Spread a tablespoon or two of your red pepper mixture in a strip down the middle of the sheet, and top with avocado and cucumber. Roll sushi and slice into six pieces.",

    "Combine all ingredients except tofu in a medium bowl, whisking until smooth. Add tofu and marinate, flipping occasionally, for at least 30 minutes, up to an hour or two. Remove from marinade and slice thin to make sushi roll, or pan fry for a couple minutes per side to make nigiri."
