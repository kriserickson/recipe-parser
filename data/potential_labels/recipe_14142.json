    "Heat cooking oil in a Tamagoyaki Nabe (rectangular omelette pan), pour a thin layer of egg mixture in the pan and spread over the surface. Cook until half done, roll up the egg, and move it to one end. Pour in another thin layer of egg mixture and let it flow under the rolled egg also. Cook until half done and again roll up the egg. Repeat this until all the mixture is gone.",
    "Wrap the rolled egg while hot in a bamboo sushi roll mat (or plastic wrap) to even out the shape. Allow it to cool and cut it into bite-sized pieces."
