    "Add the dry ingredients and beat until well combined",

    "Great Tip: Reserve a small handful Blueberries for after the batter is poured into the loaf pan. Gently press them into the top to make the loaf look prettier. Trust me.",
    "Note: If the inside of your muffin bread is not cooked through that is usually a good sign that you need to keep it in the oven longer. If it is browned on the outside and still uncooked inside, simply cover with foil and return to the oven until a cake tester inserted into the top of the muffin bread comes out clean."
