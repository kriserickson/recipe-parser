    "In a medium saucepan, heat the oil and butter over medium-high. Add the leek and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the dashi and sauce base and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and keep warm.",
    "In a large pot of boiling water, cook the soba noodles until al dente, about 3 minutes. Drain the noodles into a colander and rinse under cold running water until the water runs clear. Drain the noodles again and divide among 4 serving plates. Divide the leeks, mushrooms, and sauce among 4 small serving bowls, top each with the lemon zest, and serve with the noodles."
