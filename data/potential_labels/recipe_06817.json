    "Beat the egg into the milk along with the salt. Sift the flour into a bowl, make a well in the centre of the flour and slowly whisk in the milk and egg mixture, whisk until the mixture is smooth. Allow to settle for 20 minutes.",
    "Heat a little oil or butter in a medium frying pan. Pour enough batter in just to cover the base, cook on a medium heat for 30 seconds until browned, flip and cook the other side. Repeat until all the batter is used.",
    "The batter will keep cling filmed in the fridge for 2 days, just whisk before using. The pancakes can be made in advance, kept in the fridge for 2 days and reheated in a warm oven, wrapped in tin foil."
