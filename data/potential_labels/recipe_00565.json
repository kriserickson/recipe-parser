    "1. Heat the olive oil in large heavy-based pan over medium heat. Add the onion and fennel and cook, stirring occasionally, for about five minutes until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic, ginger, chilli, saffron and paprika and cook for a further two minutes until fragrant. Stir in tomatoes, stock, sugar and bay leaf, scraping the pan with a wooden spoon to release any stickiness on the base. Season and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "2. Gently lower the fish, mussels and prawns into the soup, cover the pan and cook for two to three minutes until the fish and prawns are just opaque and mussels have opened (discarding any that have failed to open). Check the seasoning, scatter with parsley and add a squeeze of lemon juice to taste."
