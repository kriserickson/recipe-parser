    "Instructions",
    "In a large soup pot brown beef and onion until no pink remains. Drain any fat.",
    "Add broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, and seasonings. Bring to a boil. Simmer 5 minutes.",
    "Stir in macaroni noodles and vegetables, simmer an additional 8 minutes or until macaroni is tender. Season with salt & pepper to taste.",
    "Serve with shredded cheese if desired.",
    "Recipe Notes",
    "If adding fresh vegetables add before the pasta so they have time to soften.",
    "If you are not going to be eating this all at one sitting, cook the pasta separately and add it to each bowl. If the macaroni is left in the soup overnight, it will soak up the broth and become mushy."
