    "Grease an 8 inch spring form pan with coconut oil. Set it aside.",
    "In your food processor, combine the cookies and vegan butter and pulse. You should end up with a fine meal. Press the crumbs/meal into the bottom of the spring form pan. Try to make the crust as even as possible.",

    "In your food processor, combine all of the filling ingredients – it’s that easy! Puree the ingredients until they are nice and silky smooth.",
    "Pour the filling onto your prepared crust. Using a spatula, even out the filling. Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least an hour.",
    "After the hour has elapsed, you can make the ganache/sauce and pour it on.",
    "***TIP*** If your ganache is a bit chunky, heat it up. It just means that your coconut oil is too cold (sometimes from the coldness of chilled maple syrup).",
    "Refrigerate the cheesecake for another 30-60 minutes. Serve it cold and, remember, store it in the fridge when it’s not being eaten. The filling will soften up to a pudding consistency and make it difficult to cut."
