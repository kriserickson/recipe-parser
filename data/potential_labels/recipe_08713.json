    "Place the courgette (zucchini) in a colander and sprinkle with 1/2 tsp salt. Let the juices drain for a while and then help it along by squeezing with your hands till most of the liquid has come out. At the end you should have one tightly packed cup of grated courgette.",
    "Step 2",
    "Grease the slow cooker stoneware with the oil. Beat the eggs, paprika, thyme, salt, pepper and parsley in a large bowl. Add the grated courgette, tomatoes and crumbled feta. Mix well and pour mixture into the slow cooker.",
    "Step 3",
    "Turn on low and leave for about 3 hours. All cookers vary so check your frittata after 2 ½ hours or when the surface in the middle looks dry. Insert a knife in the centre; it’s ready if the knife comes out dry of any juices. Mine took exactly 3 hours"
