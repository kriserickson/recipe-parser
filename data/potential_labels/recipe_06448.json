    "Scatter wood chips in a medium cast-iron skillet and heat over high until chips begin to smoke, about 5 minutes. Cut a 24\" sheet of heavy-duty foil and fold in half to make a large square. Fold in half twice more to make a small, thick square. Carefully place over chips and set 5 tomato halves, cut sides up, on top; remove skillet from heat. Cover with foil and top with another medium skillet. Let tomatoes sit until barely softened and smoky, 5â€“8 minutes. Transfer tomatoes to a plate and let cool slightly."
