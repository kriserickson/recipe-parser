    "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt.",
    "In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg and melted butter. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just until combined. (There should be lumps in the batter.)",
    "Place a nonstick pan or griddle over medium-low heat. Grease it with oil. Drop dollops of the batter onto the hot pan. Once bubbles form, flip the pancakes once and continue cooking 1 to 2 more minutes until the pancakes are cooked throughout. Serve immediately with maple syrup or other toppings.",
    "KELLY'S NOTES:",
    "Do not overmix the batter or the pancakes will be dense and flat rather than light and fluffy."
