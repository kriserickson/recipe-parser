    "This is the cheapest, easiest, most nutritious and damn tastiest thing on this website. The processing takes some patience with a regular food processor or blender, but be sure not to give up before the mixture turns runny– it simply won’t taste the same. Also, always use a whole packet of coconut: the recipe doesn’t work with small quantities because the lack of volume means it won’t 'take' to the blender.",
    "Using a food processor, process for about 15 minutes (or, if you have a high-powered blender, about 2 minutes) until a runny butter forms. Scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary. Store in a jar either at room temperature or in the fridge, depending on the season and climate. Use as a soft spreadable paste on toast, sprinkled with salt - if you store the coconut butter in the fridge, you'll need to 'cut out' a chunk and soften it at room temperature before using. Alternatively, melt and pour on a pancake with berries that you've simply stewed in their own juices.",
    "Tip: Pour the coconut butter in to small chocolate papers or moulds or into an ice-cube tray, and keep in the fridge to use as a white chocolate truffle-ish indulgence."
