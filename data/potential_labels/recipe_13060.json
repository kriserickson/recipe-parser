    "Heat a generous glug of olive oil in a wide saucepan and brown the pork steaks for a couple of minutes on each side until golden. Remove from the pan and keep to one side.",
    "Finely slice the onion and add to the same pan with a little more oil. Fry over a medium heat for two minutes and then add the leek and mushrooms, also finely sliced. Cook gently for 10 minutes with a lid until the leek and onion are soft.",
    "Take the lid off the pan, turn the heat up slightly and pour in the white wine. Simmer for a couple of minutes until the liquid is syrupy. Now stir in the crème fraiche, mustard, tarragon and some salt and pepper. Simmer for two minutes before returning the pork steaks to the pan, pushing them into the sauce so they are just submerged.",
    "Return the lid to the pan and cook for 5-10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks, until they’re cooked through.",
    "Check the seasoning again and serve."
