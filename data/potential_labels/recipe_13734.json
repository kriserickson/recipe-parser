    "Add orzo to the broth and let simmer for about 15 minutes. While orzo is cooking take eggs and beat until frothy. Add the lemon juice slowly to the eggs, then slowly add the reserved cup of hot broth to the lemon and egg mixture. Then slowly add egg mixture to the broth, stirring constantly to prevent the soup from curdling. Return soup to heat and stir vigorously until thickened.",
