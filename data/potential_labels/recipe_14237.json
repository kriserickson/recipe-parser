    "Cook the whole grain pasta according to the directions on the box.",
    "Produce Prep: Rinse the produce. Remove the stem and the insides from the red pepper(s). Chop the spinach and red pepper(s) into small pieces. Chop the cilantro. Defrost the frozen corn by heating it in the microwave for 45 seconds or briefly heating in a pan on the stove. Rinse and drain the canned black beans.",
    "Combine the beans, corn, red pepper, spinach, cilantro, lime juice, olive oil and cumin into a large mixing bowl, and mix together. (To make this recipe oil-free, substitute water and some extra lime juice in place of olive oil.) When the whole grain pasta is done cooking, drain it and add it to the bowl.",
    "Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, cilantro, and lime juice. Serve room temperature or chilled.",
    "Kid-Friendly Tip: Hold the cilantro, and encourage your chlid(ren) to add cilantro themselves. Allowing children some control over their meal can help boost their confidence and may reduce mealtime stress."
