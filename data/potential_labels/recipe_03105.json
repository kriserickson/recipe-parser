    "Wash the passionfruit. Remove the pulp. Place the skins in a saucepan and just cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and boil until the skins soften, then scoop out the soft pulp inside the skin. Add this to the seeds already removed, together with the 1 cup of water. Measure the pulp and liquid. Allow 1 cup of sugar for each cup. Boil briskly until set. The jam will go red in colour as it cooks. Pack and seal. Approx 3 x 350ml jars."
