    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the heavy cream and milk.",
    "Using a mandolin, slice the potatoes very thinly (if you don’t have a mandolin, you can use a knife, but it will be a lot more work and time). As you finish slicing each potato, place it into the cream milk mixture so the slices don’t brown.",
    "When the potatoes are all sliced, add the gruyere and parmigiano cheeses to the bowl, along with the garlic, the leaves from the thyme sprigs, salt, and a few cracks of black pepper. Toss well.",
    "Pour the potatoes and cream into an 8×11 baking dish, then cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.",
    "Place the baking dish on a sheet pan, then bake for 1 hour.",
    "Remove the foil and bake for 30 minutes more, until the potatoes are tender, bubbling, and golden brown on top. Serve and enjoy!"
