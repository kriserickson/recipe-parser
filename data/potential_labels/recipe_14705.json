    "Pat any excess moisture off the lamb shanks with clean paper towels. This will enhance the browning in the next step.",
    "In a heavy, cast-iron dutch oven or brazier, heat the oil over high heat, then add the lamb shanks and sear them thoroughly on all sides, using a pair of tongs to turn them. When you've got a nice brown crust on all sides of the meat, remove it from the pan and set it aside."
