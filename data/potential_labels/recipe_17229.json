    "Heat the milk until it is hot, then cool it to lukewarm. Do not let the milk boil and do not add the yeast if the milk is still hot, make sure to wait until it is lukewarm. If you add the yeast when the milk is too hot, it can kill the yeast and prevent the rolls from rising.",
    "Add the yeast to the milk, gently stir and allow it to sit for 5 minutes or until it starts to froth.",
    "Add the milk mixture, sugar, butter, and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix gently, using a paddle attachment, until incorporated.",
    "Slowly add in the beaten eggs.",
    "Then change the attachment to a dough hook and gradually add the flour to the mixture.",
    "Knead the dough with the dough hook until it's smooth and has formed a soft ball.",
    "Cover the bowl with a clean dish towel and allow the dough to rise in a warm place for about one hour. It should double in size during this time.",
    "Mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.",
    "Grease a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with softened butter or cooking spray.",
    "Once the dough has risen, knead it gently with your hands. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin into a large rectangle, about a 16 x 12-inch shape and a 1/4- inch thick.",
    "Spread the softened butter over the rectangle of dough. Sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture evenly over the softened butter.",
    "Roll the dough over the sugar and continue to roll until you have a cylinder. Pinch the edge of the dough together. Then cut 1 1/2-inch slices.",
    "Place the slices in the prepared baking pan. Cover them with a clean cloth and allow them to rise for about 30 minutes.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350 F. Place the rolls in the oven and bake for 25 to 35 minutes or until golden brown, fully risen, and completely cooked.",
    "While they are baking, beat together the ingredients for the icing.",
    "Once the rolls have cooled slightly slather the with the icing and serve!"
