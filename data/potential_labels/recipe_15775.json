    "Prepare the eggs: Fill a small bowl with water; set aside. Fill a small saucepan half-full with water. Bring water to a boil, then reduce to a rapid simmer. Using a slotted spoon, gently lower the eggs, one by one, into the pan. Cook 5-7 minutes, to your preferred level of doneness (we liked the jammy consistency achieved with a 6-minute cook time).",
    "Gently remove eggs from pan and transfer to prepared bowl of water until eggs are cool enough to handle. Discard water. Using a butter knife, gently tap around the point of an egg to crack the shell. Gently peel the egg and discard shells; repeat with remaining eggs.",
    "Prepare the hot cereal: Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan. Add hot cereal and salt and stir. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer 2-3 minutes until water is absorbed, stirring occasionally. Add spinach during last minute of cooking to wilt.",
    "Assembly: Ladle hot cereal into bowls. Top with seedy almond salad topper (use 1/2 packet per serving), sliced avocado, and coconut aminos.",
    "Hot cereal can be prepared up to three days ahead and reheated (you may need to thin it out with water when reheating)."
