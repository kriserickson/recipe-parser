    "Mix the meats, 1/4 cup onion, half of the garlic, tapioca, zest, sugar, salt, 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper, and 1 tablespoon water together in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small stockpot over low heat. Add the remaining 3/4 cup onion and 2 garlic cloves and cook until softened, stirring occasionally — 5 to 7 minutes. Add the broth, 3 cups water, remaining 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper, and the oregano and parsley sprigs and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Strain and keep warm. Transfer the meat mixture and the herbs to a food processor and blend just until smooth — about 20 seconds. Shape into 1-inch meatballs and set aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook the meatballs — 12 at a time — until browned. Bring the broth to a simmer over medium-low heat. Add the meatballs and continue to simmer until meatballs are cooked through — about 3 minutes. Serve hot."
