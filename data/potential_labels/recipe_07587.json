    "4. Remove from oven and add your favorite pizza toppings. Bake for another 5 minutes or so until cheese is melted (if using cheese) or toppings are heated and crust is crispy. For this pizza, I added sauteed onions, chicken sausage and spinach with homemade tomato sauce (tomato paste + water to thin + salt + italian seasoning).",

    "5. Using a spatula, slide crust out of pan, slice and enjoy!",
