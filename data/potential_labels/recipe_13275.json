    "1Preheat oven to 325 degrees. You will need a baking pan and some tin foil. Place the prepared corn in the center of the sheet of foil (DO NOT SALT-it isn't as tender if you do, and DO NOT ADD WATER--a lot of corn and butter flavor is lost in the water!) Salt and pepper is added if desired at the table; we don't use it, nor do we add additional butter.",
    "2Add a pat of real butter on top of each ear of corn. Wrap the corn as depicted in my photo and turn the tin foil ends up. Place on the baking pan a few inches apart. Bake in the pre-heated oven for 25 minutes. To serve: Corn may be served right in its foil boat, or removed to a serving dish. Cook's Tip: If you need your oven to cook other dishes, put your foil wrapped cooked corn in your slow cooker and turn on low to keep it piping hot for dinner."
