    "Mix all the marinade ingredients together in a bowl and add the sliced beef. Marinate for as long as you can or overnight if possible.",
    "For the beef, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan. It is ready when a breadcrumb that is dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
    "Dip the beef in the cornflour, then add to the oil and fry until slightly golden. Don't be tempted to put lots of beef into the oil at once, but cook in batches. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towel. Serve immediately."
