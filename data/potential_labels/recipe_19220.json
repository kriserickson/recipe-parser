    "Put the Shiitake mushrooms in a bowl, pour in the cornstarch and stir them round making sure they’re well covered.",
    "Warm the groundnut oil in a wok (make sure it’s nice and hot), pour in the mushrooms and fry them for 4-6 minutes (make sure they’re cooked through and slightly crisp on the outside)",
    "Take the mushrooms out of the wok, put them in a bowl and put them to one side.",
    "Turn the heat down slightly and pour in the sesame oil (make sure the wok is clean - carefully use a paper towel if needs be)",
    "Add the garlic and ginger and cook them until you release the aromas and they’re bubbling in the oil.",
    "Add the brown sugar to the wok and stir it around until it’s caramelised.",
    "Add the cornstarch, soy sauce and rice wine vinegar, stir them until the sauce has thickened slightly.",
    "Add the Sriracha and stir it into the sauce.",
    "Pour the cooked mushrooms into the sauce and stir them around so they’re warmed through and completely covered.",
    "Serve the Chewy Mushrooms over basmati rice and garnish with scallions and sesame seeds. BOSH!"
