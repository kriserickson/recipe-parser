    "Cut the chicken on the diagonal into strips about 1cm (½in) thick. Heat the oil in a wok or heavy frying pan. Add the chicken, onion and garlic, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes or until the chicken turns white with golden brown flecks.",
    "Reduce the heat to low and add the ground cumin and coriander and cinnamon stick. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add the courgettes and stir well, then add the tomatoes with their juice and the stock. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Meanwhile, put the couscous in a saucepan (off the heat) and pour over the boiling water. Add the oil. Stir well, then cover and leave to soak for 5 minutes.",
    "Add the sugarsnap peas and chickpeas to the chicken mixture. Cook for a further 5 minutes, stirring frequently.",
    "Stir the butter into the couscous and cook over a moderate heat for 3 minutes, fluffing up with a fork to separate the grains. Season with pepper. Pile the couscous on to a serving platter. Spoon the chicken on top and garnish with chopped coriander. Serve hot."
