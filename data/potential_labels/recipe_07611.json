    "Whisk milk, salt, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, rum and sugar until smooth. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Soak bread slices in mixture until saturated. Cook bread on each side for a couple of minutes, until golden brown. Serve with maple syrup and powdered sugar. If you add some strawberries and whipped cream it will remind you of the Belgian Waffles from the Worldâ€™s Fair in the 60s. Childhood bliss!"
