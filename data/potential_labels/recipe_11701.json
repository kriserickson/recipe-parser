    "Creole Chicken",
    "Trim and cube the chicken into one-inch chunks. Sprinkle with salt. Set aside.",
    "Place the olive oil into a large pan with high sides. Brown the chicken in the pan over high heat.",
    "Remove and reserve the chicken.",
    "Add the sausage to the pan and brown. Remove sausage, slice and reserve.",
    "Next, add the oregano, saffron, onion, celery, pepper, garlic, bay leaves, anchovies, capers, and reserved sausage slices.",
    "Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, and add the 1/4 cup chicken stock and tomato. Reduce liquids by half and add the rest of the chicken stock.",
    "Reduce liquids by half again. Add the chicken pieces and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally until cooked through.",
    "Season with the cilantro, parsley, lime juice and lime zest. Finish with salt and pepper.",
    "Serve with plantation cauliflower rice.",
    "Coconut Cauliflower Rice",
    "Break the cauliflower into florets, removing stems (try wrapping the whole head in a kitchen towel, then smashing on your counter 10-12 times. Perfect florets!). Place the florets in the food processor bowl and pulse until the cauliflower looks like rice (about 10-15 1-second pulses). Do this in two batches to avoid overcrowding & mushiness.",
    "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of ghee and allow it to melt. Add the jalapenos, salt, raisins, nuts, coconut and bay leaf. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine and cook until the nuts start to brown, about 3-4 minutes. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of ghee and toss in the riced cauliflower, cinnamon and cardamom. Sauté until the cauliflower is tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper."
