    "For the Caesar salad dressing: Combine the garlic, mustard, vinegar and two pinches of salt in a blender and mix thoroughly. Add the mayonnaise and blend together to form a thick base. In a slow stream add the olive oil through the hole in lid. Scrape the dressing with spatula into a bowl and season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice. If desired, add some anchovy to the dressing to create a deeper, saltier taste.",
    "For the Caesar salad croutons: Cut the baguette into cubes. Melt the butter in a skillet and add the garlic powder, paprika and pepper. Add the bread cubes and saute just until the bread cubes begin to brown. Set aside to cool.",
    "Wash and dry the lettuce. In a large salad bowl, combine the lettuce, dressing and croutons. Top with freshly grated Parmesan. Toss gently to combine well.",
