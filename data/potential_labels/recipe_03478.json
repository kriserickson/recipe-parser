    "Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a 12-inch cast iron skillet (a regular oven-safe skillet also works). Add onion, green pepper and salt, stirring and cooking for 6 to 8 minutes, until softened. Stir in quinoa, chicken stock, 1/4 cup barbecue sauce and chili powder. Bring to a light boil over medium-high heat, then turn heat down to medium. Simmer for 15 to 17 minutes, until quinoa is tender and ringlets have started to come off each grain. Liquid should be completely or mostly absorbed.",
    "Stir in remaining barbecue sauce, green onions and chicken, then remove from heat and cover. Let stand for 3 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, preheat oven to broil. Top quinoa mixture with cheese and broil, uncovered for 3 to 4 minutes, until cheese is melted. Garnish with extra green onions and sauce if desired."
