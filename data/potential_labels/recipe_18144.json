    "Season with salt to taste. Place the mixture in the fridge.",
    "Heat the oil to 375 F.",
    "Once the oil is hot, remove the falafel mixture from the fridge and roll them into little balls about the size of a pingpong ball.",
    "Add a few to the hot oil, being sure not to crowd them, and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes.",
    "For the Garlic Tahini Dressing",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together tahini, garlic, olive oil, chopped parsley, and lemon juice.",
