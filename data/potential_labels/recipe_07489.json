    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add in 1/4 cup of honey, melted coconut oil, coconut milk, vanilla, and lemon juice and mix together until completely combined.",
    "Using your hands, roll about a tablespoon of the dough into small balls and place on the baking sheet. After all of the balls are formed, press down on each ball to form a flat cookie. Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden. Place on a wire rack to cool for 15 minutes before icing.",
    "Combine the icing ingredients (room temperature coconut oil, 1/4 cup of honey, lemon zest) in a small bowl until smooth and creamy. Spread onto the cookies and serve.",
