    "In a bowl, mix cranberries with the sugar, crushed pineapple and walnuts. Place this mixture in fridge for one hour for flavors to meld and sugar to dissolve completely.",
    "Remove cranberry mixture from refrigerator. Set aside.",
    "Beat the whipping cream into stiff peaks.",
    "Add the marshmallows to the cranberry mixture, until thoroughly incorporated into the mix.",
    "Then slowly fold in the whipped cream, until it’s completely pink and beautiful!",
    "Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but overnight is even better.",
    "Note:",
    "If the dessert seems a bit watery, don’t worry because the marshmallows will absorb a lot of the moisture during refrigeration. Also, as noted above, make sure your cream is whipped into stiff peaks. You can also add more marshmallows, if necessary."
