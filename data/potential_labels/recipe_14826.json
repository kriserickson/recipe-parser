    "Preheat oven to 375ºF. Lightly grease the base of a 9-by-13 inch pan with coconut oil and set aside. In a large bowl, combine all the dry ingredients making sure they’re mixed well. If you’re using chia seeds, bloom them until all the water is absorbed. Then, mix the bloomed seeds with the other wet ingredients in a medium bowl, again making sure to mix well. Set aside.",
    "Last, toss the nuts and seeds with the oil and maple syrup. If you’re going to bake the oatmeal later, store the wet, dry and topping ingredients in separate airtight containers. Don’t wait more than 48 hours to bake the oatmeal.",
    "If you’re ready to bake now, assemble. Place the dry ingredients in the prepared pan and spread out evenly with the back of a wooden spoon. Pour the wet ingredients over the top, again making sure all ingredients are evenly distributed. Last, shake the topping over the oatmeal, covering completely.",
    "Bake the oatmeal for 25–35 minutes. You’ll know its done when the topping is lightly browned and fragrant, and the oatmeal is set. Let cool just a moment before eating."
