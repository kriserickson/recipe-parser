    "Peel two apples, cut each apple into 8 wedges.",
    "In a non-stick pan, heat gently 2 tbsp butter, add the apples, toss them around a little and let cook at medium heat for about 5 minutes. Add 3 tbsp cane sugar, mix delicately and let cook until caramelised.",
    "Grease the ricecooker’s bowl with a drop of oil and pour the apples and all the remaining caramel into the bowl. Arrange the apples to cover the bottom of the bowl.",
    "Then put together 70g (1/2 cup) all-purpose flour with 50g (1/4) cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon baking powder, a pinch of salt, 3 tbsp melted butter and two eggs, mix well and pour this batter over the apples, covering them completely. 5. Put everything back into the ricecooker and push the on-button. That’s it! :-) ps. after cooking the cake, allow it to cool in the mold for 20 minutes, and unmold delicately on a serving plate. Serve with crème anglaise or a scoop of vanilla icecream. ps: Thanks to Clea for the basic ricecookercake recipe! ;-). Serves 4 europeans (or 8 japanese ;-)."
