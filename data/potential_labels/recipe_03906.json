    "In a deep skillet or large sauté pan that has a lid, heat the oil over medium-high heat.",
    "Add the onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 4 minutes.",
    "Then add the bell peppers and let cook for about 3 minutes.",
    "Add the celery and the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are browned, about 5 minutes. Add the cauliflower and cook for 6 minutes.",
    "Add the zucchini and cook for another 2 minutes.",
    "Once the vegetables are tender, add the garlic and the herbs and spices to the pan. We waited until now to add them so they wouldn’t burn. Mix them in well.",
    "If you are using wine, add it to the pan and simmer until it is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. If you don’t want to use wine, omit this step.",
    "Add the tomatoes with their juice. Mix in the broth, capers and chickpeas.",
    "Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer over medium-low heat until it thickens a little, about 5-6 minutes.",
    "Add the kale and cover the pot until the kale is bright green. Mix it into the veggies.",
    "Remove the bay leaf or if you’re like me, forget about the bay leaf until you or someone else finds it in their food. If you find it, remove it quietly. If someone else finds it, tell them they win the prize and take it away from them.",
    "Garnish with fresh basil or parsley. Serve over brown rice or pasta."
