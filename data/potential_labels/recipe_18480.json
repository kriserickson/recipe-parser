    "Mash avocado in a medium bowl, but not so much that it becomes overly creamy. You want a mixture between chunky and creamy consistency. Next add in lime juice, grape tomatoes, diced onion, jalapeno, cilantro and salt and pepper. Give it a stir. Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary (add more salt if you like it a little bit saltier!). Garnish with extra sliced grape tomatoes, cilantro and jalapenos. Enjoy with your favorite tortilla chips!"
