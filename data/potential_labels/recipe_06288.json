    "Note: You can use regular peanut butter - but of course, that will make your cookies reduced sugar rather than sugar free.",
    "Combine first three ingredients in a sauce pan and warm gently on stove top. If you’re using raw honey, you’ll want to be careful to warm it only until the coconut oil melts and the peanut butter softens. No reason to heat the life out of your honey!",
    "Next, add in the vanilla, oatmeal, and cocoa, and stir well.",
    "Drop by the spoonful onto a saran lined plate and let cool. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator - if they last that long.",
    "Enjoy!"
