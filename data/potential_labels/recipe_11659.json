    "Coat the chicken wings with olive oil and seasoning salt. If wings are frozen, you will want to do this a day ahead of time and thaw the wings in the refrigerator.",
    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.",
    "Lay the wings on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes or until cooked through.",
    "When the wings have about 5 minutes left to bake, saute the garlic in the butter over medium heat. Add the garlic powder and onion powder and saute for about 5 minutes until the garlic has softened. The butter should bubble slightly.",
    "When wings are cooked through, remove from oven and place in a large glass bowl. Carefully pour the garlic butter and the Parmesan over the wings and stir to coat the wings with the sauce.",
    "Sprinkle with fresh Parsley (optional) and serve."
