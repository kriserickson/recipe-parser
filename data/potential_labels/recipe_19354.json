    "In a pot, combine 2 cups of the broth or water along with the milk, grits and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until completely tender, 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the remaining 3/4 cup broth or water with the black beans and cayenne and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until warm and saucy. Season to taste with salt and add broth or water by the tablespoon, if desired, for saucier beans.",
    "When the grits are tender, remove from the heat, and vigorously stir in the 1/2 cup cheese and the butter, if using, until the grits are creamy and almost fluffy.",
    "Spoon into four bowls, and top with the bean mixture, avocado, radish and scallion. Finely grate more cheese over the top, if desired, and serve warm, with hot sauce and lime wedges if desired."
