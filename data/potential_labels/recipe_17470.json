    "Place the butter in a microwave-safe large bowl. Microwave for 45 seconds or until the butter is completely melted.",
    "Whisk in the white and brown sugar until completely combined.",
    "Make sure the mixture isn't too hot (don't want to cook the egg!) and then add in the egg yolk (I believe organic eggs add so much flavor and that is what I recommend/used.)",
    "Add in the vanilla (if you have Mexican vanilla it is AWESOME) and canned pumpkin. Make sure your canned pumpkin is high quality and not watery. If it is watery your cookies will be more cakey. Drab the pumpkin with some paper towels if needed. Whisk until well combined.",
    "Add in the salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice (add amount to your desired preference). Here's where you can adjust seasonings to preference. Add less or more depending on how you usually like your baked goods.",
    "Whisk in the baking soda with 1/2 cup flour.",
    "Add the remaining 1 cup of flour and stir it in with a wooden spoon.",
    "Please note as you measure your flour that packing in too much flour will also lead to cakey cookies. I spoon the flour into the measuring cup and then level it at the top with my finger without pressing it down. Too little flour and your cookies will spread way too much and too much flour and they will be cakey. If experiencing either of these problems, you likely measured your flour incorrectly.",
    "The mixture should pull away from the edges once all the flour is added. Stir in the chocolate chips (I use and prefer milk, but use what you like!).",
    "Cover and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour. This is a crucial step and if skipped your cookies will likely spread like a pancake.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
    "Once the dough has been chilled, line a baking mat with a nonstick liner (or parchment paper).",
    "Roll two small balls of dough and the press one ball on top of the other and mesh together into one tall piece without flattening. This forms a tallish, almost vertical rectangle shape - this is how I get the cookies to look like they do and have that crisp exterior + chewy interior. Basically the bottom of the tall rectangle cookie cooks first and then the top section cooks next but for slightly less time. So that is why this shape is so important to getting your cookie to look like the ones I have pictured and have the texture described).",
    "Once you've rolled about 6-8 balls of dough, chill on the cookie sheet in the fridge for another 10-15 minutes. (I only put 6-8 cookies on a cookie sheet as they spread quite large depending on the size)",
    "While one batch is chilling you can work on rolling out another one.",
    "Take the tray right from the fridge and place it in the oven.",
    "Bake for 9-12 minutes or until very lightly browned at the bottom. The key to these cookies is slightly under-baking - that will keep them soft and chewy in the inside.",
    "Remove from the oven and allow to \"cook\" for another 1-2 minutes on the baking sheet before removing them to a wire cooling rack. This is optional but huge for appearance: I press in 5-6 additional chocolate chips into the tops of each of the cookies as soon as I remove them from the oven.",
    "These cookies taste even better the next day -- the spices and pumpkin flavor have definitely intensified by then!"
