    "For the Mix: Sift together all of the dry ingredients. Store in a sealable container in a cool, dry place for up to a year.",
    "For the Pancakes: Give the mix a good shake, then measure the amount you need and transfer to a large mixing bowl. In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together the milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla. Slowly pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture while stirring. Whisk until smooth. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "While the batter rests, heat your griddle or large nonstick pan over medium heat. Once hot, coat pan or griddle with butter or nonstick spray as necessary. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the hot griddle for each pancake, spacing the pancakes a little apart. When you see large bubbles begin to form and pop on the surface after 2 to 3 minutes (not just on the edges), flip and cook until done.",
    "For the Waffles: Preheat your waffle iron. Prepare the batter as you would for the pancakes â€” no need to rest for waffle batter. Cook waffles according to the manufacture's instructions for the waffle iron. Coat waffle iron with butter, oil, or nonstick spray as necessary.",
    "Recipe Note",
    "Using Non-Dairy Milks: Non-dairy milks like almond milk and soy milk can be used in this recipe, but your pancakes will be a bit thinner and less fluffy.",
    "Nutritional information reflects 1 batch of pancakes."
