    "To make pancakes: mix one cup of milk, 1 egg, and 1 cup of the mix together until a smooth batter forms. Cook on a griddle or skillet like normal (I recommend microwaving the mix in the bowl for 30 seconds before mixing in the milk and egg- this will soften the butter if you are storing it in the refrigerator).",
