    "In a medium bowl, combine the coffee and granulated sugar. Set aside to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Stir in the coffee liqueur, if using. Pour the mixture into a 9-inch-by-13-inch pan and place in the freezer.",
    "After 20 minutes, use a fork to stir the mixture. Repeat this every 20 minutes until the granita is completely frozen and the texture is fine, about 1 hour and 20 minutes.",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the heavy whipping cream and powdered sugar until soft peaks form. Set aside.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350°. Cut the brioche slices into thirds lengthwise and brush each brioche stick with butter. Sprinkle with demerara sugar and bake for 10 to 15 minutes until the slices are golden and crisp.",
    "Stir the granita with a fork again just before serving (to loosen the ice crystals). Serve in chilled glasses with whipped cream and toasted brioche."
