    "In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter until fluffy. Mix in the sugars and continue creaming. Scrape the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Beat for 1-2 minutes. On low speed slowly mix in the flour and baking powder. Spread half of the batter in the bottom of a greased 9x13 pan. Sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture over the batter. Take a small spoon and drop the remaining batter evenly over the cinnamon sugar. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes. Cool completely. Whisk together the powdered sugar, milk and vanilla for the glaze. Drizzle over the bars."
