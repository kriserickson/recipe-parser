    "Grease a 30x23cm (12x9in) roasting tin, line the base with greaseproof paper, and grease the paper.",
    "Put the chocolate and margarine in a bowl and sit the bowl on top of a small saucepan of gently simmering water. Melt the chocolate slowly, then remove the bowl from the pan and let the chocolate cool.",
    "Put the coffee in another bowl, pour in the hot water, and stir to dissolve. Add the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract. Gradually beat in the chocolate mixture. Fold in the flour and walnuts, then the chocolate chips.",
    "Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake in a preheated oven at 190°C (170°C fan, Gas 5) for about 40–45 minutes or until firm to the touch. Don’t overcook – the crust should be dull and crisp, but the middle should still be gooey. Leave to cool in the tin, then cut into 24 pieces."
