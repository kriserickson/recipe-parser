    ". Sometime before step 2, combine the evaporated milk, milk, and vanilla in a container that can be easily poured from.",
    "1. Mix the sugar and water in a small pot (the sugar will not dissolve completely).",
    "2. Heat the sugar and water over medium heat without stirring; let the mixture simmer until it turns a rich, dark golden brown and smells roasty (probably 10 to 15 minutes; the bubbling seems to slow down once it's almost ready). This mixture will eventually reach temperatures more than 50F above the boiling point of water, so handle with care.",
    "3. Reduce the heat to low. Add the evaporated milk, milk, and vanilla to the caramel while stirring with a heat-proof implement; the mixture may bubble somewhat violently for a short while. The caramel will likely turn into a solid mass attached to your stirring implement and/or the bottom of the pot; this is not a problem. Stir until all the caramel dissolves (do not boil).",
    "4. Once the caramel has dissolved, remove from the heat and let cool. Put the mixture into the fridge until it is cold enough to be frozen by your ice cream maker (at least 1 hour, probably more).",
    "5. Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker and freeze.",
    "6. Serve in chilled bowls once it's frozen; freeze any leftovers immediately."
