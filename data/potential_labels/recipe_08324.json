    "Preheat oven to 200ºC (180ºC fan assisted oven)/400ºF/Gas 6.",
    "Heat the olive oil and a large sauté pan, add the chicken and cook over a medium/high heat for 2-3 minutes. Add the peppers, onion and garlic and continue to cook for 5-6 minutes stirring continually until the ingredients start to turn golden at the edges. Add the Old El Paso™ Smoky BBQ Fajita Seasoning Mix and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato sauce, season with salt and pepper and stir through. Allow the mixture to simmer gently for 1-2 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes.",
    "Unroll the puff pastry sheet onto a lined baking tray. Spread the chicken mixture over the pastry, leaving a border of approx 1 ½cm’s to allow the pastry to rise. Brush the pastry boarder with beaten egg. Scatter over the cheese and bake in the oven for 20 minutes until the pastry is golden at the edges. Allow to stand for 2-3 minutes before serving with a generous sprinkling of fresh coriander.",
    "Delicious served with a dollop of cool sour cream and fresh guacamole!",
