    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a standard muffin tin with 12 paper liners, or lightly grease (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).",
    "Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl and let rest for a few minutes.",
    "Add applesauce, lemon juice and zest, oil, almond milk, maple syrup or agave, cane sugar, baking soda, salt and whisk for 45 seconds. It will foam up because the lemon juice will react with the baking soda.",
    "Add flour, almond meal and oats and stir with a spoon or spatula until just combined, being careful not to over-mix. If the batter appears too thick, add a touch more almond milk. But it should be quite thick and NOT pourable â€“ rather, scoopable. Stir in the poppy seeds whisk once more.",
    "Divide batter evenly between muffin tins (should be enough for between 11-12 as original recipe is written (adjust if altering batch size).",
    "Bake for 17-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool for a few minutes in the pan, remove from tins and let cool on a cooling rack.",
    "If glazing, whisk the ingredients together until a thin, pourable glaze is formed and brush or drizzle it on the muffins.",
    "Will keep covered for several days. Freeze for long-term storage."
