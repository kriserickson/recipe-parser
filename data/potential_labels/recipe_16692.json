    "Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper with enough overhang on the sides to easily remove the bars from the pan. Set aside.",
    "Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, mix all of the ingredients together until combined.",
    "Transfer mixture to prepared baking pan and press very firmly into an even layer. You really want it packed in tight- as tight as possible. Bake for 25-28 minutes or until top appears set and it's golden brown around the edges. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack for 1 hour, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 1 more hour. This firms up the bars which helps them stay compact. Remove bars from the pan using the overhang on the sides and cut into bars.",
    "Cover tightly and store at room temperature for 1 week or in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks."
