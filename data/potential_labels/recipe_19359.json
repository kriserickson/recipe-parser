    "In a heavy bottom sauce pan cook the lentils along with the water & turmeric powder. Bring to a boil and simmer gently for 50 minutes until the dal starts to get mushy. Stir well making sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. Turn the heat off, mash the dal with a potato masher to thicken it, cover & set aside.",
    "Heat oil in a heavy bottom sauce pan add the mustard seeds on a medium heat. As they begin to splutter working quickly add the cumin seeds, cloves, cinnamon, red chillies and curry leaves. Stir and add the asafoetida along with the green chillies.",
    "Fry for few seconds and tip in the cooked lentils along with the chilli powder, jaggery, tamarind paste and salt. Mix well and fry for a minute. Add the water and simmer on a low heat for 3-5 minutes. Stir well. Turn the heat off and garnish with coriander. Serve warm with chapattis or rice."
