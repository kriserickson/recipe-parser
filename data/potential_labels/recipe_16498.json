    "Soak the meat in cold water for 1 hour to get rid of the blood. Change the water a couple of times as it releases debris (blood and floating fat).",
    "While waiting, mix the rest of the ingredients in a bowl. (You can use a blender to quicken the process).",
    "One hour later, pat-dry the meat with some kitchen paper. Then put it into a sealable container. Pour out the sauce onto the meat and mix them with a spoon to thoroughly season. Close the lid.",
    "Marinade the meat for at least 3 to 4 hours in the fridge. Turn the meat over a couple of times during marination, so that the meat gets seasoned thoroughly. (You can also marinade overnight in the fridge to give extra tenderness and flavour. It does make a difference.)",
    "Take out the meat from the fridge 15 to 30 mins prior to cooking.",
    "Cook the meat (on a BBQ grill or a skillet or in the oven) and when both sides of the meat are cooked per your preference, serve and enjoy! – refer the note below for my preferred cooking method"
