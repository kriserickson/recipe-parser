    "Add garlic to a small saucepan, cover by 1/2 inch with cold water, place over medium flame and poach until water comes to a boil. As soon as the water boils, remove from heat, steep for one minute, drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. Let garlic cool completely. Add the garlic, mayonnaise, olive oil, smoked paprika, and lemon juice to a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Do not over mix. Taste and adjust lemon if desired and then add salt, and pepper to taste. Refrigerate to help marry flavors."
