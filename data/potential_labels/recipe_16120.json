    "Heat the oven to 180C/gas 4/fan oven 160C. Line an 18cm round cake tin with baking parchment. Cream together the butter and sugar until soft. Add 150ml/1⁄4pint of the coconut cream and the remaining cake ingredients and beat lightly to make a soft and slightly wet mixture.",
    "2",
    "Spoon the ingredients into the tin and bake for 50-55 minutes, until the top of the cake is golden and a skewer inserted comes clean. Remove from the oven allow to cool in the cake tin.",
    "3",
    "When cold, remove the cake from the tin, peel away the paper and put the cake on a plate. Put the icing sugar into a bowl and add enough of the reserved coconut cream to mix to a thick but flowing consistency. Spread the icing over the cake, allowing it to dribble down the sides, then sprinkle the toasted coconut around the top edge."
