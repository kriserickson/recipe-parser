Put dough in pan and press evenly down throughout the pan. Place in the fridge to set. Wipe out food processor.",
    "Strain cashews from water then add to the food processor and blend until you begin to get a clumpy mess. Then add melted coconut oil or ghee, honey, lemon juice, and vanilla extract and puree.",
    "And lastly, add coconut milk, 1 tablespoon at a time to break down the cashews completely. Add a couple tablespoons until cashew mixture thins out and becomes an off white color.",
    "Scoop out mixture on top of crust and smooth out. Place in freezer to set for about 1 hour. Remove from freezer and let it sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes then slice into 1 inch square pieces.",
    "Pour about 1 teaspoon over each cheesecake bite, then garnish with 1 raspberry and a small mint leaf. Repeat with all cheesecake bites. Place a toothpick in each bite for easy snacking during your party!"
