    "Follow the instructions that came with your bread machine in terms of which ingredients to put in the machine first. Then select the cake setting. I used the medium crust setting, but next time I’ll try the light setting.",
    "For those of you with machines featuring a “quick bread” cycle I think this recipe will work with that cycle too. If anyone tries it can you please post a comment and let us all know how it turned out.",
    "The cake was very good and I’ll be making it again. Incidentally, I froze the cake that we didn’t eat and that worked great."
