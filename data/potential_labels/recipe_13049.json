    "Pre-heat oven to 375°F.",
    "Put the Nutella in a small bowl.",
    "Separate the eggs, mix the yolks with the Nutella and put the egg whites in a separate bowl.",
    "Whip the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks, but not too much or they will start to separate. You can add a teaspoon of sugar or a pinch of cream of tartar to help stabilize the whites and prevent over-beating.",
    "Mix 1/3 of the whipped egg whites into the Nutella mixture. This is called sacrificing and it lightens the chocolate mixture, making it easier to fold in the rest of the whites.",
    "Add the remaining egg whites into the Nutella and gently fold with a spatula until incorporated– it’s ok if there are a few streaks.",
    "Pour the mixture into a buttered ramekin, or oven-safe ceramic mug.",
    "Cook for 15 minutes.",
    "Eat ASAP, with whipped cream"
