Butter one side of bread, place on griddle and repeat with 3 more slices. Top each slice of bread with 1/4 of tuna mixture and spread out, then top with cheese slice. Butter one side of remaining bread and place on top of cheese, buttered side up. Grill until golden brown on both sides, or cheese is melted. Remove and cut at a diagonal, serve immediately.
