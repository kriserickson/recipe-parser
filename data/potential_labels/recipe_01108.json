    "Choose your desired size baking pan (I used a 9x9, but for thinner treats use 11x7 or 13x9) and spray generously with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.",
    "In a large saucepan (I used a 5.5 qt. Dutch oven), melt butter over medium heat. Stir in pumpkin puree and cook until warmed through. Fold in marshmallows, stirring frequently until melted. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt.",
    "Let marshmallow mixture cool at room temperature for 20 minutes (cooling helps avoid soggy treats). Add the crispy rice cereal and stir until combined.",
    "Pour mixture into prepared baking pan, spread out evenly and gently press down with a rubber spatula. Refrigerate to set for at least 1 hour. Cut into squares and drizzle with melted white chocolate, if desired.",
    "Store in an airtight container up to one week"
