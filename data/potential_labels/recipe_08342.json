    "Before starting this Pain Perdu recipe, make sure you have organised all the necessary ingredients.",
    "2",
    "In a mixing bowl, crack the eggs and pour the caster sugar and vanilla sugar.",
    "3",
    "Blanch the preparation with a whisk , then pour the cold milk.",
    "4",
    "Combine well. Add orange blossom water to your taste (optional).",
    "5",
    "Cut the white bread, stale bread or brioche into 1.5 or 2cm thick slices.",
    "6",
    "Steep the bread slices into the preparation.",
    "7",
    "Remove them gently, making sure not to break them...",
    "8",
    "... and coat them with Mycryo butter on both sides. Mycryo butter is a powder cocoa butter and makes a perfect substitute to butter. No need to use extra fat, the bread is lighter and delicious.",
    "9",
    "Repeat the same operation for the rest of the slices...",
    "10",
    "... and place them gently in a non-stick frying pan.",
    "11",
    "A few minutes later, flip the slices with a spatula. Brown the other side. When cooked, remove from the pan and sprinkle with castor sugar. Enjoy!"
