    "Wrap the bacon around a scallop nicely and secure tightly with a metal skewer. You may thread two of them onto a skewer. Season both the surfaces of the scallop with some salt and cayenne pepper.",
    "Heat up the grill and place the bacon-wrapped scallops on the grill. Keep turning the scallops until the bacon becomes charred, brown and slightly crispy. Turn the skewers around so the bacon is grilled with direct heat. Grill until the bacon becomes nicely charred all around. Serve immediately."
