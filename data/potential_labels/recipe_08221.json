    "Drain the peeled tomatoes and finely chop them. In a pot, combine the tomatoes with sugar, the orange and lemon zest and juice, and cinnamon. Cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes, until the mixture gels on a spoon (it will look like a thin syrup). Skim any foam off the top, then pour the jam into sanitized jars. Seal and let the jam come to room temperature before using."
