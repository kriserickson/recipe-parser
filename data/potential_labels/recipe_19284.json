    "In a large pan heat the oil. Add the onions and gently cook until soft and slightly browned.",
    "Add all the other ingredients, bring to the boil and then simmer for around 45 minutes. Check and stir occasionally.",
    "After 30 minutes or so use a masher to break up some of the large bits. Continue to simmer until you are happy with the consistency.",
    "If serving immediately:",
    "Transfer to a bowl and chill if desired.",
    "If storing in jars:",
    "Sterilise your jars either in the dishwasher or in the oven for 5 minutes at 150 degrees C.",
    "Transfer chutney into your jars whilst it is still hot and screw on the lids tightly. A vacuum seal will form as the chutney cools. Use Marigold gloves to help when handling the hot jars and screwing on the lids."
