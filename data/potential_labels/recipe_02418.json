    "Chicory (also know as endive) has quite a bitter taste, which contrasts perfectly with the sweetness of the pear and the creaminess of the cheese. It's delicious with walnuts crumbled over the top too, if you like.",

    "5. Add the extra virgin olive oil to the jar with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.",
    "6. Put the lid securely on the jar and shake well.",
    "7. Have a taste and see whether you think it needs a bit more lemon juice or oil – you want it to be slightly too acidic, so that it's still nice and zingy once you've dressed your salad.",
    "8. Remove the pear stalk and finely slice the pear into rounds (core and all), then use good knife skills to carefully cut the slices across into matchsticks.",
    "9. Scatter the pear over the watercress, then squeeze over the remaining lemon juice to stop the pear turning brown.",
    "10. Crumble over the blue cheese.",
    "11. Drizzle over the dressing and gently toss together so everything is nicely coated, then serve.",
