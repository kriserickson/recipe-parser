    "DIRECTIONS:",
    "Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a large bowl combine first 4 ingredients and blend. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add eggs and applesauce. Stir until fully blended and all lumps removed, but don’t over stir!",
    "Grease loaf pans or line with parchment paper and divide the batter between the 2 pans to make loaves. If making \"minis\" like on the show, grease muffin tins. Bake for approximately 35-50 minutes for loaves or 15 minutes for muffins, or until a toothpick test comes out clean. My general rule of thumb is that when you begin to smell it (provided you have a decent sense of smell), its nearly done and should be checked.",
    "Bread will keep for about 5-7 days in a ziplock bag, or you can slice and freeze, toasting individual slices as desired. This is a great recipe to make in a large batch so you can freeze extra loaves and always have something on-hand.",
