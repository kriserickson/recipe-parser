    "Instructions: Boil the water in a big pot. As the water is boiling, chop up the cabbage into 1-inch cubed pieces. Once the pot is boiling, add the cabbage and lemon juice. Cook for 5-10 min depending upon how you like the tenderness of your cabbage (it's like cooking pasta al dente, etc.). Once boiled, drain the cabbage. Put it into a big bowl (it will be hot) and add the marinara sauce and parsley. Stir well. Refrigerate leftovers and feel free to reheat it whenever you like! Delish!"
