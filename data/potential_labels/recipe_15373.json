    "This creamy smoothie will really fill you up as it is packed full of protein from the nuts and avocado. An added bonus is that the linseeds or chia seeds will promote further satiety and supply you with a good dose of healthy omegas. A satisfying smart way to start the day with a kick of energy from the magnesium and chloropyll contained within."
