    "If you're pressed for time then just throw the first six ingredients in a food processor and give it a quick chop. You don't want to puree the mixture into a smoothie texture (salsa smoothie... um... no thanks). If you have a little more time, you can do this by hand, finely chopping each ingredient and stirring them together in a serving bowl."
