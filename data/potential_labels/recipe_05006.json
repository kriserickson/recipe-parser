    "Mix the oregano, olive oil, lemon juice and 1/2 tsp flaky sea salt in a large bowl and season well with ground black pepper. Put a spoonful of the dressing in a second bowl, add the lamb steaks and turn to coat. Marinate for 5 mins.",
    "Heat a griddle pan over a medium-high heat, or set the grill to its hottest setting. Discard the marinade and cook the lamb on the griddle or grill for 4-5 mins each side or until done to your liking. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with foil. Leave to rest for 3-5 mins, then slice thickly.",
    "While the lamb is resting, add the tomatoes, cucumber and olives to the dressing in the large bowl and toss lightly. Divide between 4 plates and top with small chunks of feta. Place the sliced lamb on top, scatter with the mint leaves and serve."
