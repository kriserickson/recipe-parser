    "Place the lemongrass stalks, cilantro, onion, ginger, and garlic into your food processor and process on high until smooth and almost paste-like. Place the ground pork, beef, or chicken into a large bowl and pour in the lemongrass paste. Add all the remaining ingredients and mix together well. I find using my hands the easiest way to do this.",
    "Roll 20 meatballs and place them on a baking sheet. Place enough oil in a large frying pan to thinly cover the bottom. Heat the pan over medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering. Cook the meatballs, turning them a few times, until they are well browned and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes."
