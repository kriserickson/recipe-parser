    "Heat oven to 375°. Grease four 8-oz. ramekins with butter and coat with parmesan; place on a baking sheet and chill. Cook cauliflower in salted boiling water until tender, 4–6 minutes. Drain and transfer to a food processor. Add goat cheese, nutmeg, 3 eggs, salt, and pepper; purée until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl; chill until ready to use. Whip egg whites into stiff peaks in a bowl; in batches, fold whites into cauliflower purée and divide between prepared ramekins. Bake until golden and puffed, about 30 minutes."
