    "Preheat oven to 425ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and spray with extra virgin olive oil. Wash bell peppers, and cut just around the stem to remove.",
    "Remove stems carefully and cut peppers in half lengthwise, and remove seeds.",
    "Meanwhile, mix together the egg whites with the salsa, black beans, corn kernels, wilted spinach (should be about 1/2 cup once it's cooked down), garlic powder, sea salt, and pepper.",
    "Place peppers on the prepared baking sheet, and pour the egg mixture into the pepper ‘cups,’ dividing mixture evenly between the peppers. Note: If the peppers are leaning one way or another, simply crinkle some foil into a ball, and place it under the pepper to help it \"sit\" evenly on the pan. I had to do this cause the eggs want to run out of the front of the pepper.",
    "Sprinkle shredded mozzarella on top of peppers, dividing evenly. Place in the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until cheese is lightly golden brown."
