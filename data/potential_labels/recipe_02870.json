    "Combine the orange juice, lemon juice, roasted garlic, oregano leaf, salt, pepper, bay leaves and onions, and mix in a large jar with a tight fitting lid. Marinade is best if refrigerated for up to 8 hours and will keep in the refrigerator for several weeks.",
    "Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.",
    "Ladle 10 ounces of marinade on top of the Boston butt in a roasting pan and sprinkle the oregano powder on top. Place in the oven and bake uncovered for 10 hours. (Danny likes to prepare his marinade in the morning, allow it to ferment throughout the day and places his Boston Butt in the oven to cook overnight.)",
