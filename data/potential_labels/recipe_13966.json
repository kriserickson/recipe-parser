    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "Peel bananas and cut each down the center with a knife.",
    "Heat a skillet over medium heat and spray liberally with coconut oil cooking spray. Add banana halves, split side down and let cook for 1-2 minutes, until the bottom is a little brown and the banana has softened a bit. Use a spatula to remove banana slices from the skillet, place on a plate to cool and sprinkle with a little cinnamon. (This step is optional. See note)",
    "While bananas are cooling, wash berries and slice strawberries.",
    "Grab two bowls and add two banana halves to each. I criss-crossed mine, but you can arrange them any way you like.",
    "Add 1 container of almondmilk yogurt into each bowl, allowing yogurt to cover most of the banana slices. Add fresh berries, cacao nibs and grain-free granola. Drizzle a little almond butter over each and serve."
