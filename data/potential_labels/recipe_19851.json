    "Even though the pie maker is supposed to be ‘non stick’, I spray with oil, just in case. I use frozen puff pastry and cut out circles to use as the base and the tops of the pies. You can use sliced bread as well for the pastry cases.",
    "Fill with chopped bacon, beaten egg (2 eggs makes 4 pies) and top with grated cheese. Put on the pastry tops and cook for 12 minutes.",
    "These are good served hot or cold. I guess I have something to thank Ned Kelly for."
