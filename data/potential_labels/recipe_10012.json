    "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the onions for 5 -7 minutes until the onions become translucent without browning. Add the minced garlic and continue to cook for an addition 1- 2 minutes. Add chicken broth, lemon juice, and lemon zest and allow the liquid to heat for about 4 minutes before adding the rice. When ¼ of the water has gone, turn the heat down to medium low and cook covered. Allow rice to cook for about 15 minutes checking in between to make sure rice hasn't dried out. If the rice is still undercooked and the liquid has been soaked up, add another ¼ cup of chicken broth and continue to cook for an addition 2 -3 minutes. Fluff with fork if necessary and let it sit for a few moments to \"dry out\" and lose that wet, just-steamed texture. Add the dill and parsley and stir to incorporate. When ready to serve, plate the rice in a serving platter and top with cooked shrimp and more parsley if desired."
