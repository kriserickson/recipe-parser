    "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and brown it well on both sides (this will take about 15 minutes). Remove the chicken to a plate, and set it aside. Add the onions to the skillet, and sauté until the onions are tender, about 4 minutes.",

    "Add the garlic, and sauté 1 minute. Drain the fat from the skillet. Add the broth to the skillet and scrape up any browned bits. Stir in the tomatoes, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Add the chicken, skin side up. Bring to a boil, then cover with lid ajar, reduce the heat, and simmer 30 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.",

    "Remove the chicken, and stir in the sour cream and sage. Return the chicken to the skillet, turning to coat. Serve over buttered egg noodles."
