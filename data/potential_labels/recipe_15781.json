    "Bring a large pot of water to boil, adding salt, if desired. Add 2 cups of pasta and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally for about 7-10 minutes or until al dente. Do not overcook. Remove pasta and drain thoroughly. Set aside.",
    "Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of clarified butter and heat another minute or so until it starts to shimmer. Add 1 1/2 cups of sliced asparagus, stirring until all sides are coated with clarified butter. Let cook without stirring for 2-3 more minutes until asparagus edges begin to turn golden. Add 1 1/2 cups of grape tomatoes and continue stirring until tomatoes are heated through, about 2-3 minutes. Add as much cooked pasta as desired to the pan, then mix in 1/2 cup fresh sliced basil, the juice of 1/2 a lemon and 1/2 cup of pine nuts. Keep stirring until ingredients are well incorporated, about 1-2 minutes. At this point, add up to 1 tablespoon more clarified butter if desired. Stir. Divide the pasta among two plates and top with shaved cheese blend. Enjoy!"
