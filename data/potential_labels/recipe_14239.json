    "Rinse and drain the no salt added canned black beans. In a pan or wok, warm the beans over low heat with the taco seasoning, adding a little bit at a time and tasting before adding more. Taco seasonings vary greatly by brand and batch, so tasting as you go is key! Add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper to taste if you have it. Mix the frozen corn in and heat until warm throughout.",
    "Produce Prep: Rinse the romaine lettuce to remove any dirt and pat dry with a paper towel. Rinse the avocado and cut it around the pit lengthwise. Twist to open and scoop out the inside. Rinse the jalapeno and dice. Remove the seeds for a milder heat. Beware! Do not touch your face after handling jalapenos. It will burn!",
    "Fill the romaine lettuce leaves with beans, avocado, jalapeno and pico de gallo. Enjoy your spicy, crunchy taco!"
