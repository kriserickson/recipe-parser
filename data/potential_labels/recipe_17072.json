    "In a large skillet, place the green beans and cover with water; add 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Remove green beans to colander reserving cooking liquid.",
    "Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, make a roux (known as rantas in Hungarian) by melting the butter, adding the flour, and cooking, stirring constantly, until it is a light amber color. Add pepper, paprika, and 1/4 cup water to the skillet, stirring until smooth.",
    "Temper the sour cream with a few ladles of the hot green-bean cooking liquid. Add the sour cream mixture to the pan along with green beans; whisk the mixture until smooth. Simmer until the broth thickens, 5 to 8 minutes, but do not let it boil.",
    "Serve hot or chilled."
