    "Place the berries in the baking dish. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, ginger, coconut oil, vanilla, and maple syrup and mix until crumbly (add more almond flour if needed to get a crumbly texture). Sprinkle the topping over the berries. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until slightly browned. Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream if desired."
