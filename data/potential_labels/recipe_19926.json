    "Preheat the oven to 170°C and lightly grease a 12 muffin tin or 1 large loaf tin (if making a loaf, line the tin with baking paper to make it easier to remove after baking.)",
    "Sift together the dry ingredients (both flours, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarb, cinnamon and salt) and set aside.",
    "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until pale, scraping down the sides with a spatula once or twice to ensure it is well combined.",
    "Add the eggs one at a time. Don't worry if the mixture looks curdled.",
    "Add the vanilla and milk and mix again.",
    "Add to the flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Once again scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.",
    "Fold the mashed bananas and chocolate pieces into the mixture until well combined but take care not to over mix.",
    "Pour the batter into the muffin tray to 2/3 full (or if using a loaf tin, smooth the top with a spatula)",
    "Bake the muffins for approx 25-30 minutes (or 50-60 minutes for the loaf) until beautifully risen and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean when tested.",
    "Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the tin for 5-10 minutes before carefully removing and placing on a cooling rack to cool completely. Delicious as is or drizzled with chocolate ganache!"
