    "In a large pot, cover potatoes with cold water. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes. Drain potatoes and rinse with cold water. Once the potatoes are cool, cut them into chunks, about 1/2-inch pieces. Place potatoes in a large bowl.",
    "In another large bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, mayonnaise, and mustards. Pour the mixture over the potatoes and gently stir with a rubber spatula until the potatoes are well coated. Add the onions, celery, pickles, eggs, dill and paprika. Gently stir again. Season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Serve immediately or chill in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."
