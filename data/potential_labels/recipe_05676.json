    "Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add gnocchi and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Stir in peas and cook until the gnocchi are tender, 1 to 2 minutes more. Drain.",
    "Meanwhile, toss chicken with flour in a bowl until coated. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Transfer the chicken to the pan (reserving the flour remaining in the bowl) and sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate.",
    "Add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil to the pan. Add carrot, celery, onion, thyme and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are crisp-tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle the reserved flour over the vegetables; stir to coat. Stir in broth and the chicken. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the stew is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the gnocchi and peas and cook, gently stirring, until the gnocchi are hot, about 2 minutes."
