    "Whisk together the egg yolk, vinegar, and garlic. Add the oil a little at a time, whisking/blending constantly. the mixture will be loose at first and will then turn foamy before finally pulling together and thickening. Once it starts to thicken, you can add the oil in a thin stream. If using a whisk, fold a towel under the bowl to hold it in place.",
    "Once all oil has been incorporated, add the Old Bay, mix it in and taste. Add salt and more vinegar to taste."
