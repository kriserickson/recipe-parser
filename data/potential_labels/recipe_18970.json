Transfer 2 tbsp. garlic to a plate; set aside. Add rice to skillet; cook, stirring and breaking up any large clumps, until rice is heated through and slightly crisp in places, 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and transfer to a serving platter. Top with fried eggs and serve reserved sauce on the side."
