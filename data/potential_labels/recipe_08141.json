    "In the bowl of a food processor or HIGH powdered blender, combine the dates, coconut milk, vanilla, bourbon (if using) and a pinch of salt. Process until the mixture is completely smooth and spreadable, about 5-10 minutes, scraping down the sides once or twice. The mixture should be thick, but not so thick that you cannot easily spread it on your apples. If it's too thick, add 1 tablespoon of milk and continue processing until smooth. The caramel should not at all be runny, if for some reason it is, just add a handful more of dates to the caramel and process in the food processor until smooth.Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with wax or parchment paper. Push twigs or wooden sticks into the top of the apples.Prepare your desired toppings so they are ready to press onto the apples.When the caramel is smooth and spreadable, grab one apple at a time and use a butter knife to spread the caramel all around the bottom + sides of the apple. Press your desired topping lightly all around the apple. The topping should stick right to the caramel. If your topping has a chocolate drizzle, drizzle the chocolate on the apple OR dip the bottom of the apple into the chocolate. Place the apple on the prepared cookie sheet and then sprinkle with salt (if desired). Repeat with the remaining apples. Place the apples in the fridge until the chocolate and caramel are set, 20-25 minutes. Will store in the fridge for up to 1 week....like they would ever really last that long!"
