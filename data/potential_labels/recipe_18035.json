    "Mix together the crème fraîche, mustard and lemon juice. Set aside. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Once boiling, add the broccoli and cook for 3 mins, then tip in the gnocchi. Cook until the gnocchi begins to float to the surface, this will only take 1 min so keep an eye on them, then drain.",
    "Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and, once hot, tip in the gnocchi, broccoli and frozen peas. Toss around in the hot oil for 1 min, then stir through the crème fraîche mixture. Season to taste. Once hot, spoon into bowls and top with the lemon zest and pine nuts."
