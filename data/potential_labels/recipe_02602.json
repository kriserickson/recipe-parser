    "Place butter in a Dutch oven on medium, along with peppers and shallots. Sauté until translucent, approx. 10 min. Add sundried tomatoes, vodka, 2 tablespoons dill and broth. Turn to low and continue to cook. Meanwhile in a large fry pan on high, spray with cooking spray, add chicken and remaining dill and cook until slightly browned. Doesn’t have to be fully cooked. Add to sundried tomato mixture and cook on low for 40 min. Season with salt, pepper and a touch more dill if needed. Sauce should boil down a touch and thicken. Just before serving add cream. Serve immediately over steamed rice."
