    "Put the steaming tray in place, with the pork belly inside (either the deep tray or the flat tray, which ever it fits best in). Steam for 60 min/steaming temperature/speed 2. In the mean time, preheat oven to 250 °C (or max temp) fan forced when there is 20 minutes remaining.",
    "Remove roast to roasting tray and pat the skin of the pork dry. Rub the rind with a little oil, then salt the rind liberally. Pour apple sauce around the base of the pork. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes or until well browned. If your oven is one of those ovens that refuses to produce beautiful crackling, try putting it under a medium grill before serving.",
