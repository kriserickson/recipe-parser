    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spread cauliflower, leeks and garlic on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with a few pinches of salt & pepper. Roast for 20-30 minutes, rotating halfway through. Remove when everything is starting to turn golden, but before the leeks are burning (if a few get too charred, it's ok, just pick them out later).",
    "Add to your blender (a Vitamix ideally), the veggies you just roasted, drained cashews, marjoram leaves, miso paste, a squeeze of lemon and half the water (1.5 cups). Blend until pureed. Add olive oil, paprika, and the rest of the water. Blend again. Taste and adjust seasonings.",
    "Pour into a medium saucepan and heat just until it's warm. Stir in a little more water if it's too thick. Serve with bread on the side."
