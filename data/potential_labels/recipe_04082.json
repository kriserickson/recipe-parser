    "DIRECTIONS:",
    "In a medium bowl, mix together the Nutella and cream cheese until combined. Transfer the mixture into a resealable plastic bag. Snip off a small corner of the bag.",
    "Cut bread into 2-inch slices (you should have 4 slices, not including the end pieces). With a serrated knife, make an incision from the top of each slice, about 3/4 of the way through to make a pocket for the filling.",
    "Using the resealable bag as a pastry bag, stuff each slice of bread with about 1/4 cup of the Nutella mixture. Refrigerate the stuffed slices while you prepare the batter and breading.",
    "Combine eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg in a wide, shallow bowl and whisk until light and frothy.",
    "On a rimmed baking sheet, combine Frosted Flakes and hazelnuts.",
    "Soak the bread slices in the egg batter for about 30 seconds on each side. Let excess batter drip off; transfer to the cereal/nut mixture and coat well.",
    "Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low. Add butter and oil. When the butter is melted and foamy, swirl the pan to combine, and add bread slices. Cook each side for 4-5 minutes or until golden brown.",
    "Remove from skillet and serve immediately with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and warm syrup."
