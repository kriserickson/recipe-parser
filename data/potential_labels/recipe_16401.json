    "Instructions",
    "Wonton filling",
    "Add all the ingredients for the filling in a larger bowl. Then stir it with chopsticks or fork in one direction for 3-4 minutes until the filling get sticky. When the filling is well stirred, you can feel the strong resistance when stirring.",
    "Covered and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes if you are not in a hurry.",
    "Wrapper wonton",
    "Place around 1 teaspoon of filling at ⅓ of the wrapper.",
    "Moisten the edges with your fingers.",
    "Fold the wrap in the middle to form a rectangular shape in the center part of the wrapper. Fold up the filling again.",
    "Moisten one corner and at last overlay the two corners. Repeat to finish all of those wrappers.",
    "Spicy broth",
    "Mix all the ingredients, chili oil, sesame oil, light soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and scallion well in a small bowl. And then divide into two portions and transfer to two serving bowls. Add salt and pepper separately so you can slightly adjust the saltiness.",
    "Boil water in a pot, add 10 to 20 wontons each time. Continue cooking 2 minutes after they float on the surface. In the last minute, add your Bok Choy or other green vegetables to blanch. Transfer out and serve with chopped scallion.",
    "Cook wontons for the pre-pared broth",
    "Add salt, white pepper and chopped scallion in a serving bowl, then pour around 1 cup to 2 cups of hot stock in",
    "Boil water in a pot, add 10 to 20 wontons each time. Continue cooking 2 minutes after they float on the surface. In the last minute, add your Bok Choy or other green vegetables to blanch. Transfer out and serve with chopped scallion.",
    "Cook wontons with seaweed",
    "Boil water in a small pot (holds 3 cups of water in my video), add 12 wontons. When the wonton float on the surface, place seaweed, dried baby shrimp, garlic and Bok Choy. Then turn off fire and salt, white pepper, light soy sauce, sesame oil and chopped scallion. Serve directly with the pot."
