    "Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease it lightly with nonstick spray.",
    "MAKE THE MEATBALLS: In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Cool to room temperature.",
    "In a medium bowl, mix the cooled onion mixture with the beef, egg, salt, pepper, allspice and nutmeg to combine. Add the bread crumbs and mix to combine.",
    "Form the mixture into 1-inch meatballs and then transfer the meatballs to the prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and cooked through, 15 to 18 minutes.",
    "MAKE THE SAUCE: In a medium pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.",
    "Gradually whisk in the beef broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "When the meatballs are fully cooked, transfer them to the sauce and toss to coat. Serve warm (preferably over mashed potatoes), garnished with parsley."
