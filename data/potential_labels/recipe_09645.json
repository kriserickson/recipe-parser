    "Season chicken breast lightly ( a small pinch per breast) with some sea salt and place in your crockpot.",
    "In a mixing bowl combine BBQ sauce, Italian dressing, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce. Stir until well combined.",
    "Pour over chicken, cover and cook on HIGH for 3-4 hours",
    "Once time is up, you can serve the breast whole, or shred with 2 forks. If shredding, recover and let cook in sauce for about 10-15 more minutes to soak up all that delish flavor.",
    "Serve on buns, over rice, in wraps, on a salad or eat a plateful as is! Our favorite way is on fresh rolls, topped with coleslaw."
