    "Add all ingredients to the Instant Pot. Barely cover the beans with vegetable broth.",
    "Place the lid on the pot. Make sure the pressure knob is in the SEALING position. Using the display panel, select the MANUAL/PRESSURE COOK function, high pressure, and use the +/- buttons until the display says 12 minutes.",
    "When the cooker beeps to let you know it’s finished, let it naturally release the pressure until the display says LO: 35 or until the pin has dropped. Switch the pressure knob from the SEALING to the VENTING position. Use caution while the steam escapes—it’s hot.",
    "Go to town mashing those suckers with a potato masher or an immersion blender.",
    "These beans last for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator. They also freeze well so if you’ve made too much, save them for another day!"
