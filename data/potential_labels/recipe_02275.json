    "Wash the strawberries and spread them on a double thickness of paper towels to dry. Hull and slice the strawberries into a large bowl. Sprinkle with the sugar, toss to combine and allow to sit for about 15 minutes.",
    "Whip the cream until stiff peaks form. Add the confectioner’s sugar and vanilla extract. Whip again briefly to combine.",
    "On a platter or in a baking pan, spread a small amount of the whipped cream. Begin layering starting with the graham crackers, then a layer of strawberries, and a layer of whipped cream. Continue layering until you have four layers making one of the layers with chocolate wafers instead of graham crackers. End with a layer of whipped cream.",
    "Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until the graham crackers and cookies have softened.",
    "Cut into servings and top each with a fresh strawberry."
