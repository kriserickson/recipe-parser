    "Combine the curry blend ingredients. Combine half of the curry blend with the thigh pieces; cover and chill for 30 minutes. Combine the remaining curry blend with the cardamom and mace, then set aside.",
    "Heat the ghee in a large skillet over med/high heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add half of the chicken and brown on each side, about 2 minutes per side, then remove and set aside. Repeat with the other half of the chicken, adding more ghee if needed.",
    "Reduce the skillet heat to medium, then add the onion. Saute until softened, about 3 minutes, then add the garlic, jalapeno, and the remaining curry blend; saute until aromatic, about 30 seconds.",
    "The skillet should be nice and crusty at this point (see the picture below the recipe for an example), which is perfect. Add 1 cup of the broth and bring to a simmer, scraping up the browned bits.",
    "Once the skillet is clean, pour its contents into a blender. Add the remaining broth, the cashews, the lemon juice, and any accumulated juices from the chicken to the blender. Blend until smooth, then return to the skillet. Simmer over medium heat until no longer frothy, stirring often, about 2 minutes; add the chicken and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and tender, about 5 minutes. Add more broth if it gets thicker than youâ€™d like.",
    "Add the butter cubes and stir until incorporated (this will give a silky texture to your curry). Taste and add salt if needed, then garnish with slivered almonds and cilantro leaves. Serve with rice, cauliflower rice, or something even simpler, like the blanched spinach you see in the main picture.",
    "** For added richness, stir in 1 tbsp heavy cream, coconut milk, or yogurt before serving.; if using yogurt, only add 1/2 tbsp lemon juice while cooking the dish.",
    "** To make your own garam masala, combine 1 tsp ground cumin, 1/2 tsp ground coriander, 1/2 tsp ground cardamom, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 ground nutmeg, and a pinch of allspice (yields a little more than 1 tbsp garam masala).",
    "** This dish can also be made with lamb pieces, but will require a longer braising period (step 5) to get tender (about an hour)."
