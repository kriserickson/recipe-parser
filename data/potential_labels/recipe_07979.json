    "With the tip of a sharp knife, cut small incisions in the lamb shoulders at approximately 5cm intervals. Mix together the red chilli powder, ginger and garlic paste, vinegar, yoghurt, fried onions, cumin seeds, coriander, rose petals and 1tbsp salt. Using your hands, massage the spice mixture over the shoulders, rubbing and pressing the spices into the gashes created by the knife. Set aside for 15 minutes.",
    "Arrange the sliced potato and onion on a deep oiled baking tray. Place the shoulders on top of the potato and onion slices, add the bay leaves, cinnamon and cardamom, then pour 500ml water around the shoulders and cover the tray with foil. Place in an oven preheated to 180°C/350°F/ Gas 4 and braise for 2½ hours, until the meat is very tender and ready to fall off the bone. Remove the shoulders from the liquid and place on a cooling rack. Pass the liquid through a fine sieve and reserve to make the sauce.",
    "Now roast the shoulders on a barbecue or under a very hot grill, basting frequently with the melted butter, until crisp and well browned. Finish with a drizzle of lemon juice, any leftover melted butter and the chaat masala.",
    "For the sauce, bring the cooking juices to the boil in a small pan and simmer until reduced to a coating consistency. Correct the seasoning and gradually stir in the cream, garam masala and fresh coriander. Pour the sauce over the meat and serve with naan bread.",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
    "Heat a small heavy-based saucepan on a medium heat and dry-roast the cumin lightly on medium heat for 2-3 minutes until the flavours just begin to be released. Do not let the cumin change colour or become too roasted. Allow it to cool down and then add all the other ingredients. Grind everything in a spice mill or using a mortar and pestle, then pass through a sieve. Stored in an airtight jar, this will keep for months. It adds a nice tangy, zingy flavour sprinkled over kebabs or on salad."
