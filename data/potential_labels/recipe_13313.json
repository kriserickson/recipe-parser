    "Take the casserole out of the pressure cooker. I lifted the inner pot out of the pressure cooker and then put a plate on top of the inner pot and then flipped it upside down so the casserole popped out onto the plate.",
    "Then I added the remaining cheese to the top of the casserole and let it sit for a couple of minutes until the cheese melted."
