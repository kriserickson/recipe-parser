    "Lightly grease eighteen 2 1/2-inch muffin cups or line with paper baking cups; set aside. In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in cream cheese till the mixture resembles crumbs about the size of a pea. In a small mixing bowl combine eggs, milk, melted butter or margarine and vanilla. Add all at once to flour mixture. Stir just till moistened. (The batter will be lumpy.)",
    "Fold in fresh or frozen raspberries. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Bake in oven preheated to 400 degrees F for about 20 minutes, or till golden brown. Remove from pans; cool slightly on racks. If desired, sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar."
