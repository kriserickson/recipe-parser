    "Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and line a baking sheet with parchment, set aside.",
    "In a large bowl combine the Teff flour and kosher salt, stir to combine, set aside. In a food processor fitted with the \"S\" blade combine the syrup, oil, vanilla, and peanut butter then process until smooth. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until incorporated.",
    "Scoop dough with a small cookie scoop into walnut size balls. Roll each portion in between the palms of your hands until smooth and round. The batter will be thick, but will still seem wet from the oil and syrup when you pick it up in your hands. Place on the prepared cookie sheet and gently press down with the tines of a fork to flatten.",
    "*Bake for 13-15 minutes then cool completely on the baking sheet over a wire rack before serving."
