    "Pork Filling:",
    "In a large bowl, combine all pork filling ingredients until well combined.",
    "Form Dumplings:",
    "You will need a clean workspace, wonton wrappers, prepared pork filling, a small bowl of water, and chopsticks.",
    "Begin by filling the wonton wrapper with about a tablespoons worth of pork filling. Wet your finger, and run along the edges of the wonton wrapper. This will help to seal it closed.",
    "If your wrapper is round, fold the wrapper over the filling to create a half-moon shape, pinching the edges to seal. If you wrapper is square, scroll up to view the step by step images of how I fold my dumplings into a little purse dumpling.",
    "Once you have filled the dumplings you can freeze them or eat them fresh.",
    "Freeze Dumplings:",
    "Place the dumplings in a single layer on a cookie sheet and freeze for about 30 minutes.",
    "Then place in a ziplock baggie, where they can be frozen for up to 3 months.",
    "Pan Fry:",
    "Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to the skillet and place dumplings in an even layer. Fry for a few minutes until bottoms are golden.",
    "Add 1/3 cup of water and cover with a tight fitting lid. Cook until the water has boiled away and then uncover and reduce heat to medium or medium low.",
    "Let the dumplings cook for another 2 minutes then remove from heat and serve with soy sauce and thinly sliced green onions."
