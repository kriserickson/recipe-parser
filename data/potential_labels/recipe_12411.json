    "Pour chicken stock into a large pot over medium high heat. Add prepared cauliflower, celery, and onion. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and cover. Simmer 10–12 minutes or until cauliflower is tender. Take pot off heat. With an immersion blender, blend cauliflower mixture to desired consistency (I like mine mostly smooth with a few small chunks). Set aside.",
    "In a large saute pan, melt butter over medium low heat. Whisk in flour and cook 1 minute until bubbly and combined. Gradually whisk in warmed milk, whisking until thickened.",
    "Pour mixture into blended cauliflower. Turn heat to medium, and add salt, seasoning salt, and black pepper to the pot. Stir until combined. Stir in cheese and stir until melted. Add croutons and extra cheese on top and serve."
