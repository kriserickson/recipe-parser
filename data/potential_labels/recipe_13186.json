    "Preheat the oven to 180c/gas mark 4. Butter a 25cm loose-bottomed flan tin and line the base with a circle of baking parchment.",
    "Cream the butter and sugar in a food processor or with a hand beater until the mixture is pale. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well and, after each addition, fold in some of the ground almonds and a few drops of vanilla extract.",
    "Put the mixture into the flan tin and scatter over the blackcurrants. Their flavour is intense, so don't be tempted to use more fruit.",
    "Cook for 30 minutes until golden and just firm and, before serving, sieve over some icing sugar."
