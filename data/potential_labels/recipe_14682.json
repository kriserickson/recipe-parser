    "Add drained chickpeas, lemon juice, tahini, garlic, ginger, fresh turmeric, ground turmeric, salt, and cayenne (optional) to a blender or food processor and blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides needed.",
    "To create a creamier texture, add a bit of oil and/or (if avoiding oil) water. (I used 1 Tbsp oil and 2 Tbsp water).",
    "Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more garlic or ginger for spice/zing, lemon juice for acidity, salt for saltiness, grated turmeric for earthiness, or cayenne for spice. I added a bit more ground turmeric, lemon juice, and salt.",
    "Serve as is or garnish with pine nuts, sesame seeds, or more spices. Parsley would also be a nice addition. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days."
