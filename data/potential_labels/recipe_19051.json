    "Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400°F. Lightly butter or line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with muffin liners — 9 cups for large muffins or all the cups for smaller muffins; set aside. Cut the jalapeño in half lengthwise and scrape out seeds. Thinly slice the pepper crosswise into half-moons.",
    "Place the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Stir in the milk, egg, and melted butter. Add the cheese and the jalapeño (reserving a few slivers of pepper to garnish the tops of the muffins) and fold to combine.",
    "Divide the batter between the 9 or 12 muffin wells. Top each muffins with a sliver or two of jalapeño.",
    "Bake the muffins until golden-brown and a tester inserted in the center of the muffins comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool briefly in the tin before removing and serving."
