    "Chicken stock: Bring chicken, onion, carrots, celery, and 5 quarts water to a boil in a large heavy pot. Reduce heat and simmer, skimming surface occasionally, until broth is flavorful and reduced by one-fourth, about 2 hours.",
    "Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; discard solids. (You should have about 4 quarts). Let cool, then\ncover and chill.",
    "DO AHEAD: Stock can be made 5 days ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill.",
    "Soup: Rub chicken legs with five-spice\npowder, grated ginger, 1 tablespoon salt, and\n1 tablespoon sugar; let sit 15 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, heat broiler. Spread out halved ginger and onions on a rimmed baking sheet and broil, turning occasionally, until charred all over, 15–20 minutes. Add lemongrass, cardamom, star anise, cinnamon, and cloves to onions and ginger and broil until lightly charred and fragrant, about 1 minute.",
    "Transfer onion mixture to a large heavy\npot. Add chicken stock and fish sauce\nand bring to a boil. Add seasoned chicken,\nreduce heat, and simmer until chicken is\njust cooked through, 20–25 minutes.",
    "Using tongs, transfer chicken to a plate.\nLet cool slightly, then remove skin and\nbones; discard. Shred meat. Continue to\nsimmer broth until it reduces slightly and\nflavors concentrate, 50–60 minutes. Season\nwith more salt and/or sugar, if desired. Strain into a large bowl or clean pot.",
    "Cook noodles according to package\ndirections. Using tongs or a spider, transfer\nnoodles to a colander and run under cold\nwater to stop cooking; set aside. (Keep pot of\nboiling water handy for reheating noodles.)",
    "Just before serving, return noodle cooking water to a boil. Place noodles in a fine-mesh sieve and lower into hot water to reheat, 30 seconds.",
    "Divide noodles among warm bowls and\nadd shredded chicken and bean sprouts.\nLadle hot broth over, dividing evenly. Serve\nwith Spicy Pickled Shallots, herbs, and lime\nwedges for squeezing over.",
