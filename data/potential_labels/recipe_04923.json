    "Heat oven to 110C/fan 90C/gas ¼. Tip\nthe egg whites and lemon juice into the\nclean bowl of a food mixer. Whisk until\nthe whites double in volume and hold a peak\nwhen the whisk is drawn through them. Keep\nthe whisk running and add the sugar a tbsp\nat a time, incorporating completely before\nadding the next. Whisk until all the sugar\nhas been added and the whites are glossy.",
    "Place a square of baking parchment on\na large baking sheet. Pencil nine circles,\nabout 7cm each, onto the parchment.\nSpoon the meringue into a large piping bag\nfitted with a plain nozzle and pipe concentric\nrounds to fit each drawn circle, piping two or\nmore rings around the edge to form a nest.\nBake for 2 hrs until they are crisp and lift off\nthe paper easily. Leave to cool completely.",
    "Whisk the crème fraîche until stiff, then\nfold in the yogurt. Set 2 strawberries\nand 9 raspberries aside and roughly\nchop the rest. Tip the chopped berries, mint\nand ginger into a bowl. Sprinkle with a little\nicing sugar and use a wooden spoon to mash\nto a rough purée. Gently fold the berries into\nthe yogurt mix, adding icing sugar to taste.",
    "To assemble, cut the remaining\nstrawberries into 9 slices and place\na slice inside each meringue case.\nGenerously share the rippled cream between\nthe cases, then top with a raspberry and a\nmint sprig. Dust with a little icing sugar just\nbefore serving. ( Meringues keep in an airtight container for 2 days.)",
