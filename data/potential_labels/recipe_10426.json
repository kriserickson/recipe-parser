    "Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the bread cubes, green chiles ham and cheddar cheese. Mix completely, then pour into the prepared baking dish.",
    "In the same bowl, lightly whisk the eggs to break up the yolks. Add in the milk, mustard, salt and pepper and whisk to combine. Pour the mixture evenly over the top of the bread mixture. Use your hands or a large spoon to gently press down on the bread to make sure it is completely soaked by the egg mixture. Cover and refrigerate overnight.",
    "Remove the casserole from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat the oven to 300°F. Bake the casserole, uncovered, until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour."
