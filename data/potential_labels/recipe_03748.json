    "Preheat the oven to 450˚. In a skillet, warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and stir to coat with the oil. Stir in ½ teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring frequently and reducing the heat if necessary to prevent burning, until the onions are soft and deep golden brown, about 30 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the tahini with ½ cup water, ½ teaspoon salt, the lemon juice and the garlic. Set aside.",
    "Grease a large baking sheet with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the cauliflower and turn to coat well with the oil. Spread the cauliflower on the baking sheet and season with salt. Roast until browned but not burned on the bottom, about 15 minutes. Turn the cauliflower and continue to roast until tender and browned on the second side, about 5 minutes longer.",
    "Arrange the cauliflower on a serving plate. Garnish with the caramelized onions and parsley, and drizzle with the tahini sauce. Serve immediately, passing any remaining tahini sauce at the table."
