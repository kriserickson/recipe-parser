    "Using a mandolin, carefully slice the zucchini lengthwise into 1/8 inch slices. Set the slices aside on a large rimmed baking sheet, until all of the zucchini has been sliced.",
    "Drizzle the slices lightly with extra virgin olive and season lightly with salt and pepper. Use your hands to carefully toss the zucchini, so each slice is very lightly covered with oil.",
    "Preheat a grill pan over medium heat. Add slices in batches and allow to brown on each side--avoid overcrowding the pan. Carefully remove and set aside on a large plate or clean baking sheet (once the zucchini is grilled, it will be much more delicate, so be careful not to manhandle it too much.)."
