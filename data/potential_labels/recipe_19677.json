    "Line a large plate with paper towels. Set aside. Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the snap peas, and cook until just tender, about 90 seconds. Use a strainer to remove the peas onto the prepared plate, and spread out in a single layer. Allow to cool and dry completely (the dressing wonâ€™t stick to a wet snap pea). Cut each pea in half crosswise on the bias.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the snap peas, romaine, cucumbers and green onions. Mix well to combine. Add the avocado and about half the dressing. Mix gently with your hands until the salad is well coated with dressing, adding more if necessary. Taste, and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve cold, immediately. Cover and refrigerate remaining dressing for up to 1 week."
