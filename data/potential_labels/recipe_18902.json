    "Make the tahini dressing: Put tahini, lemon juice, cayenne and garlic in a small mixing bowl, and whisk until smooth. Whisk in olive oil, yogurt and a good pinch of salt.",
    "Prepare a charcoal or gas grill, or a stovetop grill pan. Heat should be medium-high. Make sure grill racks are clean.",
    "Cut onions crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. Brush lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.",
    "Cut bell peppers in half lengthwise. Remove stems and seeds, and discard. Cut each half in two, making eight pieces. Brush lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking sheet or roasting pan.",
    "Cut zucchini and eggplant lengthwise or at an angle into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Brush slices with olive oil on both sides, and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking sheet or roasting pan.",
    "Cut tomatoes in half crosswise. Brush lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking sheet or roasting pan.",
    "Grill onions and peppers (they take longer to cook): Set onion slices carefully on grill so they don’t fall apart. Start peppers skin-side up. Peppers and onions should take 4 to 5 minutes per side. As they are done, remove to a serving platter.",
    "Grill zucchini and eggplant for about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Grill tomatoes on one side only, until heated through, about 5 to 6 minutes. As they are done, remove to a serving platter.",
    "Arrange vegetables in rows on the platter (or use two platters). Serve warm or at room temperature. Just before serving, drizzle tahini sauce over the vegetables. Sprinkle with paprika, if using, and shower with green herbs. Serve lemon wedges on the side."
