    "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook for a few minutes until the onions soften. Add the chicken and cook until lightly browned. Add three-quarters of the beer, reserving the rest, then cook for a couple of minutes to reduce. Add the black beans, kidney beans, pinto beans, tomatoes, chile powder, cumin, salt and chipotles and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer, then cover the pot and cook for 1 hour.",
