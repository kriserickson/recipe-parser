    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, coriander, and salt. Make a well in the center and whisk in the milk, eggs oil, garlic, and lime zest until well combined.",
    "Spritz a large nonstick (PFOA-free) skillet (or griddle) with cooking spray and heat over medium. In batches, ladle the batter onto the skillet, about 1/4 rounded cup per pancake. Cook until lightly browned, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. (Hint: When making pancakes in batches, you can keep the prepared pancakes warm in a 200Â°F oven until all pancakes are done.)",
    "Serve warm as desired.",
    "Serving idea: Top with guacamole, serve with a side of pico de gallo or salsa, and garnish with the fresh cilantro. Alternatively, simply drizzle with honey for a sweet and savory bite."
