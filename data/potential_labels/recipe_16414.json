    "STEPS",
    "Use a sharp knife to slice shallow slits about 1/4\" apart in one direction all the way across one side of each piece of meat.",
    "Flip the cutlets over and make the same slits perpendicular to the directions of the slits on the first side. If you make the slits in the same direction you run the risk of cutting all the way through the meat.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the sake, miso, sugar and ginger to make the Shōgayaki sauce.",
    "Dip each piece of pork in the ginger miso marinade and place them on a tray. Pour any remaining marinade on top of the pork. Let this marinate as you prepare the rest of dinner. Five minutes should be plenty of time, but you can let it marinate overnight if you want.",
    "To fry simply heat a frying pan over medium-high heat until hot (but not smoking hot). Lightly oil your pan (if you're using a lean piece of pork or other meat you may need a bit more oil) and add the marinated pork chops in a single layer.",
    "Brown on one side, flip and brown the other side. Because the sweet marinade will burn easily If the pork starts to burn before it's cooked through, turn down the heat.",
    "Serve your Shōgayaki with steamed veggies, or shredded cabbage and rice."
