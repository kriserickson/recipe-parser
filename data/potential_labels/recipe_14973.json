    "1 Warm the coconut milk: Shake the can of coconut milk vigorously before opening, then pour into a small saucepan. Heat the coconut milk to a simmer over medium heat. Stir often to avoid scorching. Warm for a couple of minutes, until the liquid almost comes to a boil. Immediately remove from heat.",
    "2 Add the chocolate: Add a third of the chopped chocolate to the hot coconut milk. Stir gently until the chocolate has completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Repeat with the remaining chocolate in two separate additions. Stir in the vanilla extract, if using.",
