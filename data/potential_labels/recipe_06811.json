    "Ok, Ready with the ingredients? Shall we begin now?",
    "First, cut the chicken into bite-sized chunks. Wash chicken pieces thoroughly, drain the water completely and pat dry with a disposable cloth or kitchen tissue.",
    "Mix all the marinade ingredients and marinade the chicken and refrigerate for at least 2 hrs (for best results, refrigerate overnight).Then bring it to room temperature before cooking.",
    "To make the sauce, heat the ghee or oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the chopped onions. Fry onions evenly until soft and golden brown.",
    "Add ginger garlic paste and fry to get an aroma.",
    "Meanwhile, grind the seeds from the cardamom pods, the cinnamon stick and cloves to a smooth powder using a pestle and mortar.Then adding the powdered spices, fry for a minute or so.",
    "Now, add tomatoes and tomato puree plus 300ml water, bring to a simmer, cook at medium heat until the oil starts to pool around the sides of the pan.",
    "Meanwhile, heat your grill as high as possible, and thread the chicken onto metal skewers well together. Put on a lined baking sheet as close to the grill as possible and grill chicken well on each side for about 8-10 minutes, until nicely charred at the edges.",
    "Puree the sauce until very smooth. Once the chicken is grilled, return the pureed sauce to the pan on a medium heat. Mix any remaining marinade into the sauce, along with the chillies, cream and paprika . Add the grilled chicken, fenugreek and garam masala into the pureed sauce and cook in a medium heat for about five minutes.",
    "Pour in the cream and garnish with coriander leaves, off the flame and serve it hot.",
    "NOTE: Chicken Tikka Masala goes well with Rice Pulao, Biryanis and Naan. You may like to order some from an Indian restaurant nearby."
