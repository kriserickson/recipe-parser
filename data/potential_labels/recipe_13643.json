    "Directions",
    "Place dates in a bowl and pour the hot water over them. Cover the bowl and allow dates to soften for 10 minutes (longer if your dates are dry). Once soft, transfer dates from the water into the bowl of a food processor, reserving the water. Add the remaining ingredients, except for apples, and process until smooth, stopping often to scrape the sides down. With the food processor running, add the reserved soak water by the tablespoonful until desired consistency is reached; it should be just thin enough to pour but still a little thick.",
    "To serve, core and slice the apples, placing each one in its own serving dish. Pour about a quarter of the caramel sauce over each dish of apples and allow each person to choose their own toppings. Serve with a knife and fork and enjoy!",
