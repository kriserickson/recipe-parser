    "Spoon pizza sauce along the center of the pizza dough, then sprinkle with 3/4 cup of the shredded cheese. Top with 1/3 cup of pepperoni slices, then sprinkle with another 3/4 cup shredded cheese and remaining 1/3 cup pepperonis.",
    "Starting from one end, fold strips of dough over the filling to the center, so the ends overlap and it looks braided. Sprinkle top with remaining cheese and a few more slices of pepperoni.",
