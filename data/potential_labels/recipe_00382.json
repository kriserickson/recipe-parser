    "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.\nRemove the stalks from the mushrooms.\nHeat half the oil in a large frying pan\nand sizzle the mushrooms for 3-4 mins\non each side until golden and cooked\nthrough – add a drop more oil if needed.\nLift the mushrooms out onto kitchen\npaper to drain.",
    "Place the same pan back on the heat\nwith the rest of the oil. Fry the garlic for\na moment, add the spinach to the pan,\nthen cook for 2-3 mins over a high heat\nuntil completely wilted. Season with salt\nand pepper, then tip the spinach into a\nlarge sieve to drain thoroughly.",
    "On a lightly floured surface scattered\nwith the thyme leaves, roll the pastry out\nto the thickness of a £1 coin. Using a\nsaucer and a larger-size plate, cut out\n4 circles about 5cm wider than the\nmushrooms (for the bottoms) and 4\ncircles about 10cm wider (for the tops),\nre-rolling the trimmings if you need to.",
    "Place the 4 smaller circles on a baking\ntray and top each with a quarter of the\nspinach, making sure the pile of spinach\nisn’t wider than the mushrooms. Top\nthe spinach with a slice of cheese, then\na mushroom, smooth-side up, and top\nthe mushroom with another slice of\ncheese. Brush the border to each circle\nwith egg, then gently stretch the larger\ncircle over the mushroom, trying not\nto trap any air, then press the edges\ntogether with a fork. Trim the edges\nwith a knife if you want, then brush each\ngenerously with egg. Bake for 40 mins\nuntil golden, then leave to cool for a\nfew mins before serving."
