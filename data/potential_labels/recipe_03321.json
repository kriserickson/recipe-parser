    "Cut your sweet potatoes into one inch cubes and set in a sauce pan. Fill with cold water and a dash of salt, and bring to a boil. Boil until fork tender, strain, and set aside. When cool, mash, so that you have about 1 1/4 cups mashed sweet potato.",
    "Meanwhile, melt the butter and separate the eggs.",
    "Preheat your waffle iron, set the oven to 200 degrees F, and slide a baking sheet in it to warm.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the flours, cornmeal, baking powder, spices, and sea salt.",
    "In a medium bowl, combine the sweet potato mash, melted butter, egg yolks, milk, and sugar. Fold the wet ingredients into the dry.",
    "Use a beater (or big-time muscles) to beat the egg whites to soft peaks, and fold into the batter, stirring just until everything is nicely combined.",
    "If needed, grease the waffle iron, and then cook waffles according to your waffle iron’s instructions. (Mine make 4 inch waffles, and I found that 1/3 cup batter worked best for these.) Store cooked waffles on the baking sheet in the warm oven.",
    "We served our waffles with Citrus Salad: Toss citrus pieces with olive oil, rice wine vinegar, and salt. With the addition of maple syrup, it was pretty perfect, so you may want to follow suit.",
