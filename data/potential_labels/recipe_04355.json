    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Combine brown sugar, steak seasoning, chili powder, and cumin in a small bowl. Set aside",
    "Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add bacon to the pan. Cook for 5 minutes until the bacon is soft and renders fat. Add ground beef and do not break it up. Let it sear on one side, about 2-3 minutes. Flip it and sear on the other side, about 2-3 minutes. Then begin to break meat up with a metal spatula or wooden spoon, cooking it until the meat is no longer pink. Add sugar and spice mixture to the skillet and stir to combine. Add onion, red peppers, jalapeño, and garlic to the skillet. Reduce heat to medium. Add red wine vinegar and Worcestershire sauce to the mixture, and cook for 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce and paste to pan. Stir to combine. Reduce heat to simmer and cook 25-35 minutes longer until mixture is thick and no longer soupy.",
    "Using a large spoon or ice cream scoop, pile sloppy meat onto toasted, bun bottoms, sprinkle with grated cheddar cheese and cover with bun tops."
