    "If using fresh tomatoes, pour boiling water over them in a bowl, count to 30, then lift out, peel and chop.",
    "Heat the oil in a heavy-based frying pan with a lid and add the onions and garlic. Soften gently, stirring occasionally. Stir the chilli, cayenne, oregano and bay leaf into the onions. Stir-fry for 1 min, then stir in the squash, olives and wine. Simmer for a couple of mins, stirring, then add the tomatoes and 200ml water. Crumble in the stock cube and stir. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 30 mins, stirring occasionally.",
    "Add the peppers to the pan and check the seasoning. Add extra water if it’s looking dry. Cover and cook for a further 25-30 mins until the squash is tender. Can be frozen at this stage for up to 1 month – defrost overnight in the fridge before continuing with the recipe.",
    "Add the beans to the pan and reheat. Serve with chives and soured cream on the side."
