    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "Mix all the ingredients in a bowl and mix with hands until well blended. Form beef mixture into balls about 3 to 4 ounces each. Place in a greased baking dish, cover with foil and place in oven for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and check to make sure they have cooked completely through. Remove the foil and place back into oven for 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from oven and let sit for 15 minutes to let some of the juices absorb back in to the meatballs. Drain remaining grease and serve with your favorite pasta and sauce.",
