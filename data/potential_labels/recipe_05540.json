    "Cut the Persian cucumbers into fourths lengthwise and then cut into slices. (If you have to use regular cucumbers, they may need to be fully or partially peeled.) Dice the tomatoes, slice the green onions, and slice the olives. Combine the vegetables in a salad bowl, large enough to toss the ingredients together.",
    "Put the cottage cheese on top of the tossed vegetables. Drizzle with a generous amount of olive oil, sprinkle with Za'atar to taste, and toss again. Serve right away, with more Za'atar to be added at the table."
