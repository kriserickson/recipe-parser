    "Place whiskey and sugar in a warm coffee mug. Stir the mixture until the sugar is dissolved. Pour hot coffee into the mug, the layer a dollop of soft whipped cream on top.",
    "You can adjust the amount of sugar to your liking. To make soft whipped cream yourself, take heavy cream and whip it just until it thickens. You do not want to whip the cream to the point where it forms peaks. Slainte!"

    "About This Recipe",
    "\"In 1942, a man named Joe Sheridan invented Irish coffee at his restaurant at Foynes Airport, near today's Shannon Airport. The drink was created to relieve the Irish damp chill for passengers flying to the United States. Stanton Delaplane, a writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, tried Irish coffee at Shannon shortly after the war. He enjoyed it so much that he brought the recipe home. The first Irish coffee in the United States was served at Buena Vista Cafe on November 10, 1952. Soon after, more Irish coffee was being consumed in San Francisco than Ireland. This drink might be responsible for single-handedly saving Irish whiskey. Irish coffee consists of coffee, sugar, Irish whiskey, and soft whipped cream. The drink traditionally does not have a maraschino cherry or green creme de menthe on top.\"",
