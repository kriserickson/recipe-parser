    "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, salt and pepper. Sweat the onion until translucent. Add the fennel and garlic, a pinch more salt, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for another few minutes.",
    "Add the parsnips, carrots and herbs de provence and another pinch of salt. Continue cooking for 8 or so more minutes. Deglaze the pan with the white wine, stirring to get any bits off the bottom of the pan. Let the wine reduce for another few minutes.",
    "Stir in tomatoes, broth and beans. Reduce heat and let it simmer until the root vegetables are tender. 20-30 or so minutes.",
    "While you wait, make the pistou. Coarsely chop the herbs, then grind all ingredients in a mortar and pestle. (or pulse everything in a food processor). Taste and adjust. (hint - wait and taste it with a spoonful of the soup before adjusting).",
    "Add the chopped chard leaves, macaroni noodles and fennel fronds, and continue to simmer until the noodles are cooked. About 10 more minutes.",
    "Taste and adjust seasonings. Finish with generous squeezes of lemon, grated parmesan cheese, and a spoonful of pistou, per bowl. Serve with crusty bread."
