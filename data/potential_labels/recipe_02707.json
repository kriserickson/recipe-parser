    "Prepare an ice bath. Line a baking sheet with a clean kitchen towel and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat, add the asparagus and cook until almost tender, about 4 minutes. Drain the asparagus in a colander and immediately transfer them to the ice bath to stop the cooking. When the asparagus are cool, about 1 minute, drain, then transfer them to a towel-lined sheet pan to drain.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk together the kumquats, olive oil, white wine vinegar, green garlic, ginger and salt. Add the asparagus and gently toss so that the vinaigrette coats each spear.",
