    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9x5 in (23x13 cm) loaf pan with parchment paper.",
    "In a large bowl, stir together the almond flour, psyllium husk powder, baking powder, and sea salt.",
    "Stir in the eggs and melted coconut oil, then finally the warm water. Try to mix it well to create air bubbles.",
    "Transfer the batter to the lined baking pan. Smooth/press the top evenly with your hands, forming a rounded top.",
    "Bake for 55-70 minutes, until an inserted toothpick comes out clean and the top is very hard, like a bread crust. (Important: It will pass the toothpick test before it's completely done, so make sure the top is very crusty, too.) Cool completely before removing from the pan."
