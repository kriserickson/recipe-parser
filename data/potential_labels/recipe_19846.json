    "In a large saucepan or stove pot (Make sure it is large! You will be adding all ingredients to this pot!), sautee your onion in olive oil.",
    "Once your onion is just about cooked through, add in all your mushrooms and continue to sautee.",
    "Once onions and mushroom are cooked well, stir in your beef mince and cook until nicely browned.",
    "Now the fun part! Start adding in your spices while stirring well after each: Oregano, Salt, Cracked Pepper and Sweet Paprika.",
    "Stir in your sauces, again stirring well after each sauce addition: Tomato Sauce,Â Worcestershire Sauce and Soy Sauce.",
    "And finally, prepare 1 1/2 cups of gravy and stir into your meat mixture. Should you wish to make a thicker mixture, sprinkle more gravy powder into the pot and stir well. Alternatively, you could also use cornflour."
