    "add puréed chipotles in adobo sauce to a heap of sauces for some extra spice and flavor. They’re great thrown into a barbecue sauce you already love or into some mayo to get you to that intersection of spicy and fatty. (That's right, you can make your own chipotle mayo at home.) Chipotle mustard. Chipotle ketchup. Chipotle tartar sauce. The world is your oyster."
