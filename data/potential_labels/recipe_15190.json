    "Heat a large pan over a medium heat and add a little oil. Fry the sausages for 3-4 minutes until coloured on all sides. Remove and set aside. Add the chorizo pieces, cut-side down, and fry for 2-3 minutes until they start to release their oil and crisp up. Turn over and colour on the other side for a minute or two. Remove and set aside with the sausages.",
    "Add the garlic, celery and carrots to the pan and stir for 2 minutes until the garlic is tender. Stir in the lentils, add the sausages, chorizo, bay leaf and thyme springs and stir well.",
    "Add 600ml of the stock, then taste and season. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer gently for 25-30 minutes until the sausages are cooked, the lentils tender and the stock well-flavoured. If the stock levels drop too low while the lentils are cooking, top up with a little of the remaining stock.",
    "Discard the bay leaf and thyme and serve the bollito misto in bowls, garnished with parsley."
