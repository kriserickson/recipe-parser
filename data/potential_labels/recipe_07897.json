    "Ingredients",
    "• 5 pasture-raised eggs (or organic, omega-3 eggs)",
    "• 1 pack Let's Do Organic Creamed Coconut (key ingredient; *details below about this)",
    "• ¼ cup organic virgin coconut oil, melted (or extra virgin olive oil)",
    "• ½ Tbsp. dried organic basil (an Italian herb blend and/or rosemary would be delicious too)",
    "• 2 tsp. organic garlic powder (to taste)",
    "• ¼ cup organic Parmesan cheese, divided",
    "• 5 organic sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil, sliced (try Mediterranean Organic)",
    "• ½ tsp. Sea Salt",
    "• ¾ tsp. baking soda",
    "* For the \"Let's Do Organic Creamed Coconut\", this may not be in every grocery store, but I found it in Whole Foods, or you can get it at the Thrive Market above. This is VERY different than just coconut cream or milk, as this contains the fiber from coconuts too, which is key to making this recipe come out properly."
