    "In a non-reactive bowl, whisk everything together except the water. Add more kombucha to get the ketchup to desired consistency. Place in an airtight jar and use right away.",
    "Notes",
    "The kombucha will continue to ferment in the ketchup so if you donâ€™t eat it up right away, it will go sour and even alcoholic after a few weeks. You can either freeze it in small batches or you can cook the vinegar before adding it to the ketchup."
