    "Step 1 Preheat oven to 180°C. Brush a round 20cm (base measurement) cake pan with oil to lightly grease. Line the base with 1 1/2 sheets of rice paper.",
    "Step 2 Spread almonds and pistachios over a baking tray. Spread hazelnuts over another baking tray. Bake in oven for 5 minutes or until toasted. Place the hazelnuts on a clean tea towel and rub to remove skins. Place almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts, figs, flour, ginger, cinnamon and cloves in a heatproof bowl.",
    "Step 3 Place honey, combined sugars and water in a saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, without stirring, for 3 minutes or until a candy thermometer reaches 116°C or 'soft ball stage'. (If you don't have a thermometer, drop 1 teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of cold water. If the syrup becomes a soft ball, it's at soft ball stage.)",
    "Step 4 Pour honey mixture into nut mixture and stir to combine. Spoon into prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake in oven for 45 minutes or until firm. Set aside in the pan to cool. Lightly dust with icing sugar and cut into wedges to serve."
