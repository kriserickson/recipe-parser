    "Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. Add the beans in a single layer. Stir to coat the beans in the oil, then let them sit long enough to brown on one side – about 3-4 minutes – before turning to brown the other side for about the same length of time. The beans should be golden and a bit crunchy on the outside.",
    "Add the tomatoes and allow them to cook for a few minutes, or until they begin to break down.",
    "Add a little more oil to the pan and allow it to heat a little. Add the kale and a pinch of salt to the pan, then cook for a couple of minutes, turning all the time until it is tender and the edges have crisped.",
    "Stir in the walnuts and garlic, then wait 10 seconds and stir in a good grating of nutmeg. Wait another 10 seconds and stir in the lemon juice and zest. Remove from the heat. Serve with grated parmesan and some bread for a hearty meal."
