    "in a large bowl, whisk flour, baking powder and salt. add the olive oil and mix with your hands until oil is evenly dispersed and the flour resembles small crumbles. by the tablespoon, work water in little by little with your hands - you may need more or less water depending on your brand of flour. in the end, you want your dough to be pliable, but not too sticky. once dough comes together kneed and form into a smooth ball, brush with a bit of oil and cover with a dish towel - let rest in the bowl for 8-10 minutes",
    "divide dough evenly into 2 pieces (place second piece back in the bowl and cover). take a large piece of parchment paper and dust it with flour. form dough into an disk and flour the top of the dough (you can either use a second piece of parchment or a floured rolling pin), and roll dough into a 9-10 inch circle - if edges crack just pinch back together",
    "repeat with second piece of dough when ready"
