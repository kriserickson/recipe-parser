    "What you do:",
    "This fits in my 6 liter (6.4 qt) cooker. All measures are approximate. Adjust to your taste. Nothing is pre-cooked! Just toss it in & go.",
    "1) Prepare all ingredients. Cut potatoes into 1\" chunks. If you chop a few of the veggies into a finer dice, they will cook down and help thicken the stew.",
    "2) Combine all ingredients except for the parsley and salt and pepper in your pressure cooker. Add additional water or broth to cover vegetables.",
    "3) Cook at regular to high pressure for 6 minutes. Quick release the pressure once finished. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the stew is too thick after cooking, just add liquid. Stir in fresh parsley and enjoy.",
    "This is a very flexible recipe. All measurements are approximate - adjust/add/omit to your taste. This is wonderful on its own but would also be good over rice, other grains, pasta, etc. Use any kind of beans or a mix. Small red beans, navy beans, blackeyed peas, black beans, etc... larger ones might not cook fully.",
