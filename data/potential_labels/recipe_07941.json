    "Place a large pan over medium heat. Add a tablespoon or two to the pan. Once the pan is super hot, add the strips to the pan without crowding it. Cook for about 1 minute on both sides. You may need to do this in 2-3 batches depending how big the strips are.",
    "Place the strips on a cooling rack that has been placed on top of a baking sheet. This will help the chicken strips cook on both sides without getting soggy. If you don't have a cooling sheet, you will just have to flip them half way through the baking.",
    "Place baking sheet in the oven and cook for 10-12 minutes or until no pink remains inside the chicken.",
    "Let cool on baking sheet before serving. Dip them into maple mustard sauce!"
