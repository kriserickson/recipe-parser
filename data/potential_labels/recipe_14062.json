    "For any Brits trying this recipe (we dont get graham crackers here) use 60g of digestives and 60g of rich tea biscuits as a substitute. (120g in total =1 cup)",

    "Just one problem–they’re too easy to make which means I’ll probably find every excuse to be making them. Oh, two problems: I accidentally left a bit in the bowl and had to finish that right away. If you like Reese’s peanut butter cups, this will be like having as many as you want and no one will discover your secret as you try to sneak thru the checkout stand.",

    "I was so excited to make and deliver these to a friend today but realized I am out of graham crackers. Do you think Golden Graham cereal crushed up could work as a replacement? I noticed a box in my pantry and I am just trying to save my 2 month old from another trip to the store By the way I have been a huge fan of your recipes. Usually when I bake something my husband just says “Sally’s?”. Thanks for sharing such great ideas with us!",

    "Hey Lisa!! Thank you so much for the sweet comment. And YES, golden graham crumbs would be a wonderful replacement",

    "Thank you for this recipe Sally!!! My son is nut allergic, and I made this for him with SunButter’s creamy sunflower butter. YUM! I must admit, I saw this recipe and made it immediately after seeing it!!",
    "Sally\t— SEPTEMBER 9, 2017 @ 9:36 AM\tREPLY",
    "I’ve made these with sunflower seed butter in the past (for a friend who has a nut allergy) and I love them that way too! I’m so glad you tried them",
