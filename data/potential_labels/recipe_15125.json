    "Preheat oven to 350Â°. Spray a 9-inch round cake pan with non stick cooking spray. Carefully unwind each roll into a long strip of dough, leaving center coiled. Coil the unrolled end of each strip in toward center, making two equal coils. Pull middle of strip down to make a point, forming a heart shape; pinch point. Place in pan, points toward center. Bake 13 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 5 minutes before removing to cooling rack. Spread or drizzle over very warm rolls. Optional: add sprinkles.",
    "TIP: To make the icing easy to drizzle, take off the metal top and microwave 15 seconds in the plastic tub the icing came in."
