    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium/large size bowl and set aside. In a small bowl, mix oil, sugar and vanilla. Combine wet ingredients with dry ingredients and mix briefly, set aside. Mash bananas, you should have approx. 1 1/2 – 1 3/4 cups, add to batter and mix until combined. If mixture seems too dry, add a bit of non-dairy milk, maybe 1/4 – 1/2 cup at most. Add in chocolate chips and mix briefly. Spoon into a well-greased or paper lined muffin tin, fill each muffin about 2/3 – 3/4 full. Bake for about 20 – 25 minutes. You can also do the toothpick test in the center of one muffin, if it comes out clean it’s ready. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 min.",
    "Makes about 10 – 12 muffins. (I got 10 muffins but was tasting the batter, about 1 muffin worth. I could’ve made 12 if I used a tad bit less on each muffin and didn’t eat the dough.)"
