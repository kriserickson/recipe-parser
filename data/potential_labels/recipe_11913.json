    "In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, chipotle and lime juice. Spread mayo mixture on top half of each roll. Spread bottom half of each roll with avocado and season with salt and pepper. Top with turkey, cooked bacon and a slice of cheese. Combine halves to form sandwiches.",
    "In a large, heavy skillet over medium heat, melt 1/2 Tbsp. butter (or mist a grill pan with cooking spray). Add sandwiches topside down; cover with foil. Place a second heavy skillet (or pot lid) on top to press sandwiches. Cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip sandwiches, adding 1/2 Tbsp. butter to pan or misting with cooking spray. Cover with foil and skillet. Cook until cheese melts, about 4 minutes. Halve sandwiches; serve hot."
