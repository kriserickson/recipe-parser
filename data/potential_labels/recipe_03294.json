    "Start by placing your chicken breasts evenly into the slow cooker. I recommend adding a slow cooker liner to make clean up a breeze.",
    "Next, mix your Ranch salad dressing mix and 1/3 cups of water in a bowl. Make sure to mix it as thoroughly as possible for an even taste to the chicken. **Note: Your mix will be lumpy – there is really no way around that – just make sure it is mixed as well as possible.** Once it is mixed, pour evenly over your chicken.",
    "Cover and cook on low for 3 hours.",
    "After three hours, mix up your cream cheese and can of cream of chicken soup. I recommend warming your cream cheese in the microwave for about 30 seconds to make the mixing a little easier.",
    "Pour the mixture over the top of your chicken and do not stir. You want to create a topping of sorts. As the mixture heats, it will seep down and around the chicken.",
    "Recover and cook for an additional two to three hours on low or until your chicken reaches the desired tenderness.",
    "When you are 30 minutes away from being ready to serve, cover your chicken with shredded cheese, turn the slow cooker off and cover.",
    "Your cheese will melt, creating a gooey, creamy topping. While you are waiting for the cheese to melt, boil your noodles and set them aside to cool. Dish up one piece of chicken from the bottom, making sure to keep the cheesy crust in tact and place on top of your noodles.",
    "You will have a tender chicken dish that has just a hint of ranch taste and a great cheesy flavor!",
    "This is a huge crowd pleaser and super simple to make! Serve with a side of veggies and you have a meal the whole family is sure to enjoy!"
