    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Season chicken tenders with salt and pepper. Season the almond flour generously with salt and pepper.",
    "Beat 1 egg together with 1 tbsp of heavy cream.",
    "Dip each tender first in the egg wash and then into the seasoned almond flour. We like to place the tenders in a Tupperware container with the almond flour and shake to coat. A Ziploc bag also works well.",
    "Place tenders on a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes. If they are not as crispy as you would like you can additionally broil them for 2-3 minutes.",
    "Allow tenders to cool for 5 minutes and then place them in a tupperware container, add the buffalo sauce and shake to coat. Gently shaking is best to prevent the batter from falling off."
