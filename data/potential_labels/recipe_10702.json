    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C), and arrange pecans on a bare baking sheet. While the oven is preheating, peel, core, and thinly slice apples (see photo).",
    "When the oven is preheated, bake pecans for 7 minutes. Then remove from oven, top with coconut oil, coconut sugar, maple syrup, cinnamon and salt and toss with a spoon or spatula until evenly coated (I like doing this on the pan to save time/mess, but you can also do this in a mixing bowl). Bake for 3-6 minutes more, or until fragrant and deep golden brown. Be careful not to burn. Set aside.",
    "While the pecans are baking, add coconut oil and apples to a large, rimmed skillet and begin cooking over medium heat. Add coconut sugar, cinnamon, ginger, lemon juice and arrowroot or cornstarch (optional) and toss/stir to combine.",
    "Cover the apples and reduce heat to medium-low to soften for about 10-15 minutes - stirring occasionally.",
    "Once the apples are tender and soft (sample one to check), remove cover and increase heat to medium. Sprinkle on a bit more cinnamon and coconut sugar and stir to coat. Cook for 2-4 minutes more - this will add a slightly sticky, caramelized finish to the apples. Set aside.",
    "To make sundaes, divide apples between serving dishes and top with 1-2 scoops of Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Cream (homemade or storebought). Garnish with pecans and sprinkle with pecans.",
    "Optional: Serve with Date Caramel, heated on the skillet and slightly thinned with maple syrup OR my Coconut Sugar Caramel Sauce from our Everyday Cooking Cookbook!",
    "Best when fresh. Store leftover pecans at room temperature in a sealed container up to 2 weeks. Store leftover apples in the refrigerator up to 4 days."
