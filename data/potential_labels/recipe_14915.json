    "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Unroll the dough onto a clean, lightly floured work surface. Slice the dough into 3 equal strips widthwise. Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce, about 2 tablespoons, onto each dough strip, making sure to leave a border without sauce. Sprinkle about 1/4 cup of the cheese onto each strip. Line up the meatballs side by side along the length of each dough strip. You should get about 10 meatballs per strip.",
    "Roll the dough up to cover the meatballs, forming a log. Slice the log in between each meatball, then pinch the dough together on one end of each sliced piece to seal. Put the pieces on the baking sheet pinched-side down (exposed meatball side up). Top each with about a teaspoon of sauce and a sprinkle of cheese.",
    "Bake until the dough is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool a few minutes before serving. Serve with warm pizza or marinara sauce on the side for dipping."
