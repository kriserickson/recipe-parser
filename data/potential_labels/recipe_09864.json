    "Place the lemon juice and tahini in a food processor and blend for about 30 seconds or until well combined and creamy. You may need to scrape the sides once or twice to get the ingredients to fully combine.",
    "Add the zucchini, olive oil, cumin, sea salt, black pepper and garlic and blend until smooth. You may need to scrape the sides once or twice.",
    "Transfer the hummus to a medium sized bowl and place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.Â Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and a couple dashes of paprika for garnish.",
    "NOTE: If you have an ripe zucchini, place the sliced and chopped pieces in a colander with a little salt. Allow the zucchini to drain for about 20 minutes and then pat dry with paper towels before adding it to the recipe. This will remove the excess moisture and help ensure the hummus it not too watery."
