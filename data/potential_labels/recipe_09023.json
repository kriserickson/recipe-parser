    "Preparation",
    "Preheat your oven to 375 F.",
    "Using a blender or a food processor, pulse the cauliflower until you get a texture finer than rice.",
    "Steam the riced cauliflower over boiling water for 5 minutes.",
    "Place the steamed cauliflower in a dish towel and squeeze out as much excess water as you can. You might want to let it cool for a few minutes first, so you don’t burn yourself. You should be able to get out a lot of water; be really aggressive about squeezing it, or you’ll end up with soggy tortillas later.",
    "Transfer the cauliflower to a bowl. Add in the eggs, oregano, and paprika, and season to taste ( you can use any spices you like).",
    "Separate the mixture into 6 balls of equal size, and spread each ball out on a parchment-lined baking sheet to make six small circles.",
    "Place in the oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes; then flip and cook for another 5 minutes.",
    "Reheat in a pan placed over low heat when ready to serve."
