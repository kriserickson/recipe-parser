    "First, prepare the pasta according to the package instructions. Drain it well and allow it to cool.",
    "Heat half of the extra-virgin olive oil (about 2 tablespoons) in a large skillet over medium heat and add the minced garlic. Cook for just a minute or two, stirring, then reduce the heat to low and add the chopped fresh basil and parsley.",
    "Cook for just one minute, until heated through. You just want the freshÂ herbs to start to get gently warmed in order to release their flavors as much as possible, but you don't want them to actually wilt or start to cook.",
    "n a large bowl, combine the cooked and drained pasta with all of the remaining ingredients, including the cooked garlic and herbs, the remainder of the olive oil, lemon juice, pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese.",
    "Season generously with salt and pepper, to taste.",
    "Toss your pasta salad well and serve it cold. You may also want to let it chill for an hour or two in the refrigerator before serving to let the flavors really develop."
