    "1. If you are using frozen fish, defrost it. Turn oven on to 150C, 300F, Gas 2",
    "2. Heat up the oil in your fryer / pan until it reaches 180C / 350F.",
    "3. Check over your fish for any bones. If you have a thick part and thin part of the fish, cut the thin part off as we will cook this separately to avoid over cooking. (see shapes of fish in photo). Pat dry with kitchen paper.",
    "4. Mix your flour and salt and pepper well in a shallow dish and cover the fish with the flour and shaking off any loose flour."
