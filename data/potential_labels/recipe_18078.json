    "Grind all the spices (cumin, fennel, sesame, coriander seeds, and cashew) in a grinder or mortar. Place the lime juice, minced garlic, spice mix, olive oil, salt and pepper in a bowl and mix to combine.",
    "Place the chicken, in a large salad bowl. Rub the marinade over the chicken and let sit for 15-20 minutes. Drain from the marinade and stir-fry the chicken tenders in a hot skillet until golden and cooked through. Add the marinade at the end of cooking and cook for 2-5 minutes more; make sure you don’t burn the spices of the marinade, you just want them slightly caramelized.",
    "While the chicken is cooking, place the cooked quinoa, cilantro, parsley and scallion in a bowl and toss to combine.",
    "Serve the chicken with the herbed quinoa, sprinkle with extra sesame seeds and drizzle with extra oil to serve. Enjoy ♡!"
