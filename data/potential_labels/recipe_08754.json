    "Clean the portobello mushroom caps with a damp cloth, remove the stem and scrape out the gills so you have a well deep enough for the egg.",
    "Rub a little bit of olive oil on the outside of the mushroom to help it cook and keep it from sticking to the pan. Arrange the caps on a baking sheet.",
    "Place one slice of prosciutto inside the mushroom cap.",
    "Crack each egg into a small bowl and then carefully slide it onto a prosciutto-filled mushroom cap.",
    "Sprinkle with black pepper and fresh herbs of choice – I used parsley but thyme would be great as well. (The prosciutto is salty so I don’t recommend adding more.)",
    "CAREFULLY place the baking pan into the pre-heated 375 degree F oven and bake for 20-30 minutes. The amount of time required depends on how thick your mushrooms are and how done you like your eggs.",
    "I hope you like this paleo baked eggs breakfast recipe.",
    "Here’s hoping your eggs stay firmly in place on their mushroom caps and you stay warm in the winter."
