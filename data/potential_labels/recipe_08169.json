    "Put the ancho chiles in a small bowl and cover with hot water. Let rest for 30 minutes.",
    "Cook the bacon over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed pot until crisp. Remove the bacon and let drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Set aside.",
    "Saute the onions and garlic in the residual bacon grease for about 5 minutes, until soft. Add the celery and carrots and sauté over medium heat for another 5 minutes. Add the red pepper and corn and sauté another 5 minutes.",
    "Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables, stirring over medium high heat. Cook 3 to 4 minutes until the flour bubbles and begins to brown. Whisk in the chicken stock and add potatoes, Old Bay, and Spanish paprika. Bring to a boil.",
    "While the soup is coming to a boil, remove the ancho chiles from the bowl and put them in a food processor or blender. Whirl to chop and add 1/4 cup hot water and whirl again. Add the chile purée to soup. When pot comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, add crab, and simmer until potatoes are al dente.",
    "When the potatoes are done, add cream and season with Worcestershire sauce, salt, fresh cracked pepper, and parsley. Taste and adjust seasonings.",
    "Serve in individual bowls with lime wedges and garnish with crumbled bacon. I recommend serving with big hunks of crusty garlic bread."
