    "Blend all ingredients except the pastry crust in a high-speed blender, starting slow then increasing speed and blend until smooth and creamy. Pour mixture into the unbaked pastry crust. Bake for 50-60 minutes until middle is cooked. Allow to cool for 30 minutes, cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight before serving.",
    "Pro tips",
    "For a delicious brown sugar pumpkin drizzle, combine 1/4 pumpkin puree, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup water, and 2 tsp pumpkin spice in a small pan. Whisk together and heat on low to medium, and bring to a simmer. Allow to cool and drizzle over a piece of pumpkin cheesecake with some crushed pecans for added flavor and texture.",
    "For a creamy, vegan whip topping, put a can of full-fat coconut milk in the fridge overnight. Once chilled, remove the lid and scrape out only the solid part on top, into a bowl. Add 1/4-3/4 cup of powdered sugar (depending on desired consistency and sweetness) and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Mix with a high speed mixer into a fluffy, delicious topping."
