    "Remove the fat from the boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut into large pieces (I had 7 pieces of chicken in my crockpot)",
    "Add in the quinoa (rinse first to remove the bitter tasting saponin coating) and beef or chicken broth.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, white sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, ground ginger, minced garlic, and pepper until well combined.",
    "Pour over everything.",
    "Chop the peppers and stir in. If desired, add in a chopped onion or half of an onion in here now too. See the second paragraph of the post for other ideas on vegetable additions.",
    "Put on high for 2 and 1/2 - 3 and 1/2 hours depending on your slow cooker. Mine took exactly 3 hours, but watch carefully because all slow cookers will cook differently.",
    "Shred the chicken (it will absorb a great deal of the liquid) and pour in the drained pineapple chunks.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water until smooth. Pour in the crockpot and give everything a good stir. This is optional just for thickness.",
    "Serve with sesame seeds and a chopped green onion if desired."
