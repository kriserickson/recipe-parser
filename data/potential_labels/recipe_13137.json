    "Preheat the oven to 375 F.",
    "For the streusel, in a medium bowl, mix together dry ingredients and then drizzle the butter over it a little bit at a time, using a fork or whisk until mixture is clumpy. Set aside.",
    "For the filling, in a medium pot (or Dutch oven), melt the butter and cook the apples, sugar, cinnamon, and salt over medium-high heat. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples have softened (about 6 or 7 minutes). Add raisins (if desired) and cooked another 7 minutes covered. Transfer cooked apple mixture to a bowl with a slotted spoon leaving the apple juice in the pan. Add cream, stirring frequently, and cook until reduced by half, about 3 or 4 minutes. Add the cream to the apple mixture.",
    "Bake the crust blind for 10 – 12 minutes, then remove crust from oven. Spread the apple filling evenly into the warm, partially baked pie crust. Sprinkle the top of the pie with the streusel mixture.",
    "Bake the pie until the crust and streusel have lightly browned, about 25 – 28 minutes. Transfer the pie to a wire rack and cool to room temperature before serving.",
    "Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving."
