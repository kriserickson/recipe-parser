    "Preheat the oven to 400 (F).",
    "Cut your thawed puff pastry into 6 x 3 inch rectangles.",
    "Add chocolate in one half of the rectangle, forming two lines with the chocolate chips.",
    "Fold the side of the puff pastry over the half containing the chocolate, and flip the roll so that the seam is on the bottom facing the pan. If you leave the seam up, the puff pastry will burst open and you'll end up with a pastry that looks more like a gallette than a roll.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of water. Use a pastry brush to brush the beaten egg and water mixture on top of the rolls. Sprinkle with a dash of sea salt.",
    "Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or, until puffed and golden. The rolls should have doubled in size during the baking process. When ready, cool for 5-10 minutes on a cooling rack and serve immediately -- the rolls are best when served fresh. Enjoy!"
