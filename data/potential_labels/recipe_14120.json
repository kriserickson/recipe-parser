    "Directions",
    "Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line 6 cups of a muffin tin (I used silicone molds).",
    "Combine all ingredients in a food processor and process until everything is well combined (you may have to stop and scrape down the sides a few times).",
    "No food processor? No problem! Mash the bananas in a bowl. Add remaining ingredients, and whisk together until fully combined.",
    "Once everything is mixed well, spoon batter into lined muffin cups. The batter will be VERY sticky, but I found wetting a spoon kept it from sticking.",
    "Place muffin pan in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, (it may take longer depending on your oven) until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Wait until these are completely cooled before removing from the pan.",
    "Store these muffins in the fridge. They should last at least 5 days. You can also freeze them for longer storage. Enjoy!"
