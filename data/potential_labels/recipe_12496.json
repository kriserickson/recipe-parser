    "Preheat the oven to 400°F. Dry off your tofu with a paper towel and cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Toss with the cornstarch and arrange the tofu on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Bake for 30-45 minutes – midway through, flip the tofu cubes.",
    "When you have just 5 minutes left on the baking time (at that point your tofu should be a light golden brown) start the sauce. In a small frying pan, heat up honey, soy and garlic over medium heat until bubbly and thick. Taste and season with freshly ground pepper.",
    "Remove the tofu from the oven and toss in the sauce. Garnish with sliced green onions and toasted sesame seeds. Enjoy hot!"
