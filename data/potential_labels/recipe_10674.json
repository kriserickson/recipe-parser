    "Cooking Directions",
    "Get your smoker going. Wash and dry the potatoes and set them into a large baking dish. Smoke the potatoes at 225 degrees for 2 hours. You should check them after 1.5 hours by piercing them with a knife. If it goes through easily, the potatoes are done. I used a ½ cup of cherry wood for smoking these potatoes, giving them a nice, light smoky flavor.",
    "Remove potatoes and slice them into half inch slices. Add them to a large bowl.",
    "Dice the avocado and add them to the bowl.",
    "Slice the roasted jalapeno peppers into rings and add them to the bowl.",
    "To a small mixing bowl, add vinegar, mustard, mayo, lemon juice and garlic. Whisk until smooth.",
    "Pour the mixture into the large bowl along with cilantro. Toss everything until the potatoes-avocado are nicely coated. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with extra cilantro and a bit of paprika."
