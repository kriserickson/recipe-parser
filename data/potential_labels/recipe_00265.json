    "Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan160°C/gas 4. Grease and line a 20cm x 20cm square brownie tin with baking paper. Put the butternut squash into a small, heatproof bowl and splash over a little water. Cover in cling film and microwave on high for 8-10 minutes. The squash should be soft and cut like butter.",
    "Drain away any excess water, then add the chopped chocolate to the bowl and stir to combine. The residual heat of the squash will melt the chocolate. Using a hand-held blender, whizz the mixture to a purée and set aside.",
    "Crack the eggs into a large bowl and add the sugar. Using an electric hand mixer, whisk until light and fluffy, then fold through the cocoa powder, plain flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt.",
    "Fold in the chocolate squash purée, then transfer to the tin. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the brownies have set. Remove and allow to cool in the tin for at least an hour. Cut into squares and serve with a dusting of icing sugar."
