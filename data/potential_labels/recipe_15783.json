    "Peel carrots and trim ends, discard ends and peels. Slice carrots in half crosswise, then slice in half lengthwise. Add carrots to a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil, vinegar, and salt, and toss to coat. Spread carrots evenly on prepared baking sheet and tuck a few sprigs of fresh thyme in between the carrots.",
