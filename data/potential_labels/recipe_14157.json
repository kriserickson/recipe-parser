    "Cook the whole grain pasta according to the directions on the box.",
    "Produce Prep: Rinse the kale and chop it into tiny bite-sized pieces. Peel the garlic.",
    "Blend the cashews, dried basil, garlic, nutritional yeast, olive oil, and water in a high-powered blender or food processor. (Feel free to omit the oil for an oil-free version).",
    "In a bowl, mash the extra firm tofu with a fork. Pour the cashew seasoning mixture over the extra firm tofu and stir to combine. (Depending on the water content of the extra firm tofu, your 'ricotta' may require extra liquid. Add olive oil and/or unsweetened soy/nut/rice milk for extra flavor and liquid, and salt to taste.)",
    "Add a little bit of water to a pot, pan or wok with a tight-fitting lid. Bring up to medium heat. Add kale and cover to cook for 2-3 minutes.",
    "Add the 'ricotta' mixture to the pan (pour it over the kale in the pan or wok), and then cover. Reduce heat to low and heat until the ricotta is warm throughout (3-5 minutes).",
    "Top the whole grain pasta with the kale and 'ricotta' mixture. Salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy!",
    "Kid-Friendly Tip: Some children prefer different food items to be kept separate from each other on a plate. It gives them more control over what they're eating, and it can be more appealing that way. Keep the kale on the side and let them taste the whole grain pasta with the 'ricotta' before slathering the 'ricotta' over their serving of whole grain pasta. They might just prefer the kale or 'ricotta' on the side."
