    "In a sauce pan, over medium-high heat, combine all taquito filling ingredients. 2. Mix well and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "3. Wrap tortillas in a damp towel and microwave for 15-20 seconds.",
    "4. Place about 2 tablespoons of filling across the tortilla about ⅓ of the way up from the bottom of the tortilla, and roll the tortilla around the filling.",
    "5. Heat about ¼ inch of oil over medium-high heat. Carefully, place 3-4 taquitos in the oil, and cook for 3 minutes on each side. (Frying them seam side down first helps them stay closed during frying!)",
    "6. Remove from the pan and drain excess oil on the taquito on a paper towel.",
    "7. Place cooked taquitos on a bed of lettuce and garnish with crema, cilantro, cotija, and avocado.",
    "8. Serve & enjoy!"
