    "Combine yogurt, chopped parsley, chopped cilantro, juice and zest from the lime, olive oil, minced garlic, paprika, cumin, sea salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the sauce; cover and refrigerate. Place salmon in a medium Ziploc bag. Pour in the remaining yogurt mixture, seal the bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 10 (or up to 30) minutes. Meanwhile, preheat grill to medium-high. Oil the grill rack. Remove the salmon from the marinade, blotting any excess. Grill the salmon until it is browned and just cooked through, 7-8 minutes per side. Top the salmon with the reserved sauce and garnish with lemon wedges."
