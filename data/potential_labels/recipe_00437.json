    "Dissolve the coffee granules in the milk, and then add all the ingredients except the caramel and pinch of salt, and mix them together in a bowl by hand until well combined.",
    "Divide the mixture evenly between 2 small bowls, teacups, or ramekins.",
    "Drop 1 - 2 teaspoons of caramel into the middle of each pudding - it will settle down towards the bottom of each.",
    "Microwave each individually on full power for 45 seconds. At this stage the pudding will be firm but still a bit gooey in the middle. If it is too under cooked or too gooey (all microwaves are different), simply microwave for a few more seconds until you are happy with the degree of firmness."
