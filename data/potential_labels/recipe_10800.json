    "Cook the orzo according to the package directions. Drain and let cool.",
    "Whisk together the oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, herbs, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Pour about 1 to 4 tablespoons of dressing into the bottom of each jar, to taste.",
    "After the dressing, layer the salad ingredients into each jar in order: about 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes; then 1/4 cup cooked orzo; 1/4 cup snap peas; 2 oz mozzarella; and last, about 1-1/4 oz of baby spinach leaves, torn into bite-size pieces (or just fill the remaining space in each jar — it’s okay to pack it in fairly tight). Screw the lids onto the jars tightly and refrigerate immediately.",
    "When you’re ready to eat, unscrew the lid and shake the salad out into a bowl. The action of shaking the salad into the bowl usually mixes the salad and dressing conveniently; if not, just toss the greens a bit with your fork to combine. Then enjoy!"
