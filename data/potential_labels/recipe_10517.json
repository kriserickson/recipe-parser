    "Place the clean potatoes in a pot and cover with cold, salted water. Place over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain very well. Cool enough so that you can handle — but the warmer they are when you smash them the better.",
    "While the potatoes are simmering, preheat your oven to 400° F on convection or 425° F if you don’t have convection.",
    "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Now, I use a heavy glass for the next step but you can use a can, mallet or anything else you might have to press each potato down until it’s smashed into a disk. Smash/press them until they’re all the same thickness and line them up on your baking sheet in a single layer (use another baking sheet if there’s not enough room on the first one).",
    "Drizzle 2 Tbsp. of olive oil over the potatoes, making sure each potato gets some. Sprinkle 3/4 tsp. of salt oven them and then flip them all over. Drizzle another 2 Tbsp. of olive oil and another 3/4 tsp. of salt oven the potatoes.",
    "Place in the oven and roast for 20 minutes, or until they’ve started to brown. Flip them all over again and roast another 20 minutes or until they are all browned and crispy. Serve right away (ketchup is optional)."
