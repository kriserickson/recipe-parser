    "For the empanada dough: In a large bowl combine the flour and salt. Using a potato masher, cut in the butter until the flour turns a golden yellow color and the butter pieces are no larger than a pea. Stir in enough cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together and forms a ball. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.",
    "For the filling:",
    "Roast the poblano peppers on a comal or over an open flame, until the skin has charred evenly all over. Place in a plastic bag and let set for about 10 minutes. (This allows the chilies to sweat, making them easier to peel.) Peel off the charred skin from the roasted peppers and remove the seeds. Chop the poblano peppers into bite-size pieces.",
    "In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter over high heat. Add the onion and saute until transluscent, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chicken and saute until the chicken is no longer pink. Stir in the poblano peppers, corn kernels, and Mexican crema. Cover skillet and reduce heat to low. Let simmer for about 15 minutes until the chicken pieces are tender. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Stir in cheese cubes.",
    "Preheat oven to 350F. Roll out the empanada dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. Using a large square cookie cutter or sharp paring knife, cut the dough into 4 to 6-inch squares. (The bigger the squares, the bigger the empanada.) Spoon desired amount of filling into the center of each square of dough. Lightly moisten the edges of the dough with water. Fold the empanada dough diagonally over the filling to form triangles. Press edges to seal. Transfer the empanadas to a generously greased baking sheet. Brush the tops of the empanadas with the beaten egg. Pierce the center of each empanada once with a fork. (This allows the steam to escape and prevents dough from puffing.)",
    "Bake the empanadas at 350F for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve with Mexican crema. Enjoy!!!"

    "Today is one of those food holidays that I just couldn't let slip by unnoticed. That's why I suggested to Girlichef that we celebrate this special holiday for She Made/Ella Hace this month. In case you didn't know, today is Empanada Day! Now, isn't that the kind of holiday that you could really get behind. Since Girlichef and I already shared a sweet empanada recipe with all of you a couple of months ago, I also suggested that we make savory empanadas.",
    "And since this month in my cocina is going to be dedicated to Kids' Favorite Recipes (because April is Children's Month in Mexico), I thought I'd start the celebration by sharing my 15 year old daughter's favorite savory empanadas, which also happen to be made with what I believe to be one of the best flavor combinations ever...chicken, corn & roasted poblano peppers. (Swoon!)",
    "The empanada crust is buttery, crisp and flaky. And the filling is creamy and cheesy, with just a hint of spice from the roasted poblano peppers. I like these Poblano Chicken Empanadas as is, but Hope (my daughter) thinks they're best when dipped in Mexican crema!",
