    "If you haven’t prepared your vegan queso yet, do that first (recipe in the ingredients).",
    "Once your queso is ready (and hot), heat up your black beans in a small saucepan and season with a little sea salt and desired spices (I love garlic, cumin and chili powder).",
    "Next, prepare your guacamole by mashing your avocado with lime juice and sea salt. Adjust seasonings as needed.",
    "Arrange your chips on a large serving platter and add toppings in desired order. I like black beans first, then queso, salsa, guacamole, red onion, jalapeno and cilantro. Enjoy immediately."
