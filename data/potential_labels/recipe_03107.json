    "Place a large saucepan or casserole dish on a high heat and add a little of the oil.",

    "In the same pan turn down the heat to low setting, add some more oil and gently fry the onions until translucent, followed by the sliced celery. Cook for a few more minutes until the celery and onions have softened.",

    "Add the browned venison, bacon and reduced port, followed by the prunes and stock.",

    "Add the carrots and Swede and cook on a low heat for another hour or 2 until the vegetables are cooked through and the venison can be cut through with a spoon.",
    "Check the seasoning before serving, carefully adding a little more mace or cloves to taste.",
