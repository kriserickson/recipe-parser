    "Bring broth to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add rice, lentils,, and bay leaf and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice and lentils are tender, 35–45 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let sit 5–10 minutes (there should still be some broth remaining). Discard bay leaf and season with salt and pepper. Set rice mixture aside.",
    "Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cumin seeds and toss to coat. Cook, stirring often and adding water to pan as needed to prevent burning, until onions are golden brown and soft, 20–25 minutes.",
    "Mix half of onion mixture and half of herbs into rice mixture; season with salt and pepper. Top mujadarra with yogurt, remaining onion mixture, and remaining herbs, and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over."
