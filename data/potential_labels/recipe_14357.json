    "Instructions",
    "In a bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together all of the ingredients in the peanut butter layer. Let gel for about 10 minutes, and then transfer to a blender. Blend until smooth. Remove from blender into a bowl or liquid measuring cup and set aside. Repeat steps to make the chocolate layer, no need to wash the blender between layers.",
    "Once both layers are made, layer the chocolate and peanut butter puddings in small jars or cups, alternating as desired. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.",
    "Alternatively, if you don't want the chia pudding blended, stir together the ingredients for the peanut butter layer in one bowl, and stir together the ingredients for the chocolate layer in another. Let them each set for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator, and then layered into cups or jars.",
    "Store in the refrigerator. Top with a drizzle of peanut butter and a sprinkle of chocolate chips or cacao nibs to serve!"
