    "Combine the cranberries, sugar, and crystallized ginger with ½ cup water in a medium saucepan. Add the juice and grated zest of one of the oranges. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is thick and the cranberries are mostly disintegrated, about 7 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, peel the remaining orange and chop its flesh. When the cranberry sauce is thick, remove it from the heat and stir in the orange flesh. Cool thoroughly and serve. (Store cranberry sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.)"
