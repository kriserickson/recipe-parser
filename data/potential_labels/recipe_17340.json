    "Instructions",
    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a large baking sheet (or more if making larger batch) with foil or parchment paper.",
    "In a small mixing bowl toss rinsed and dried chickpeas with oil and spices and spread on baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes or until slightly crispy and golden brown. Once slightly cooled, sample and adjust seasonings as desired (I added a bit more sea salt, cumin and garlic powder for extra flavor).",
    "While the chickpeas are roasting, prepare your sauce by adding hummus, lemon juice, dill and garlic to a mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Add enough water or almond milk to thin so it’s pourable (~2-3 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust amount if altering batch size).",
    "Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Add more garlic for more zing, salt for savoriness, lemon juice for freshness, and dill for a more intense herb flavor. I found mine didn’t need anything else.",
    "To serve, warm pitas or flatbread in the microwave for 15 -30 seconds (or the still warm oven for 1 minute) and top with desired amount of chickpeas, sauce, and vegetables of choice.",
    "Best when fresh, though leftover chickpeas and sauce will keep well stored separately in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.",
    "Notes",
    "*You can sub 2-3 tsp fresh dill per 3/4-1 tsp dried dill",
    "*If you don’t have hummus, tahini will make a great base substitution for the sauce - just adjust the seasonings to accommodate the lack of flavor tahini provides.",
    "*Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated without optional sea salt, with the pita bread, but without other serving ingredients."
