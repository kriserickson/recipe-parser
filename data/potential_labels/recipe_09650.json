    "NOTE about beef: The pictured meet is the vegetarian crumble... that is why it looks browned. You do NOT have to brown the beef before putting into the crock pot. I did not pre-cook the meat first. If you are using a higher fat ground beef (like an 80/20) you might want to precook to drain off some of the fat. But if you don’t mind the extra fat…that isn’t even necessary, just a suggestion.",
    "First mix together the can of tomatoes, and tomato paste in crockpot.",
    "Next add broth, beef, garlic, parsley, basil, onion, V8 and salt/pepper.",
    "Cover and cook on LOW for 7-8 hours or on HIGH for 4-5 hours.",
    "When 30 minutes are left of cooking time, add in the 1 cup of water and noodles. Stir to combine. Put lid back on and continue cooking for 30 minutes."
