    "Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain well and pour the noodles back into the pot or into a large mixing bowl.",
    "In a large skillet over medium-high, sauté the onions in olive oil for 8-10 minutes, or until they are soft and starting to brown. Add the mushrooms, salt and pepper and continue to cook until all of the mushrooms are cooked through and have released some of their juices. This should take another 8-10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and their juices to the noodles and mix thoroughly.",
    "Taste the noodle/mushroom mixture to check for seasoning. Add more salt or pepper if necessary. When you’re happy with the flavour, allow it to cool for a few minutes. Then add the flour and eggs, mixing well.",
    "Pour the mixture into a greased 9″x13″ baking pan and bake at 375 for 55-60 minutes, until the top has turned a dark, golden brown and the kugel has firmed up. Serve!"
