    "Tofu: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Press some / most of the water out of the tofu. Cut into cubes. Toss gently in a bowl with the cornstarch until coated. Drizzle with oil and soy sauce. Transfer to baking sheet and bake for 30-40 minutes, until golden and crispy. Toss with a little bit of hoisin sauce.",
    "Chopping: While tofu bakes, chop the veggies.",
    "Vegetables: Heat the oil in a large, deep pot over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and bok choy. Saute for 3-5 minutes, until soft. Add garlic, ginger, and curry powder. Saute for 3-5 minutes, until fragrant.",
    "Noodles: Add the broth and bring to a simmer. Add ramen noodles and simmer until cooked (usually takes 3-4 minutes). Add coconut milk. Season with salt and lime juice.",
    "Finish: Serve ramen and broth in bowls, topped with tofu, sesame oil, sesame seeds, green onions… you get the idea. Grab your chopsticks and Go. To. Town."
