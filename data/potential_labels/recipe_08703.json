    "Score the fish skins and rub in the garlic and ginger. Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan with a lid. When the oil is sizzling lay the fish in, skin side down, cook for 1-2 minutes until the skin is crisp but the fish isnâ€™t cooked through.",
    "Gently lift out the fish and set aside on a warm plate. Toss the kale and chilli in the pan, reduce the heat to medium then tip in the soy sauce and the juice of half the lime. Toss until the veg is well coated.",
