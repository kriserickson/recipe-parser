    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Use an ungreased 10-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet. Slice butter into skillet and set over medium heat until melted. Remove from heat and whisk in sugar and brown sugar; let cool slightly. Whisk in egg and vanilla until light and well blended. Stir in pumpkin puree and mix well. Dump flour, baking soda, salt and pumpkin pie spice into skillet and whisk well, scraping down sides. Stir in chocolate chunks. Spread batter evenly in skillet. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until set and lightly browned around edges (do not overbake). Let cool in skillet. Serve it directly from skillet."
