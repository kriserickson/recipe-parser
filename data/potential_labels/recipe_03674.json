    "Soaking the cashews in water for a few hours will reduce blending time. If you are not using a Vitamix, I highly recommend soaking the cashews so they blend into a smooth and creamy texture.",

    "Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.",
    "Place the cooked edamame and thawed stir-fry blend into a food processor. Pulse multiple times until the ingredients are well blended. It should be green and have a fine consistency similar to that of short-grain rice.",

    "Form into 6 patties and place on the prepared baking sheet.",
