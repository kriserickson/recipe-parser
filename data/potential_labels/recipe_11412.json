    "Cook the oatmeal according to package directions. For extra awesome creamy oatmeal, cook it in milk!",
    "Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the maple syrup, cinnamon, and vanilla, and let it bubble around for a little bit to get incorporated. It should be lightly foamy and bubbly.",
    "Add bananas and simmer for a few minutes on each side until soft and plump.",
    "Remove from heat. Stir half of bananas into oatmeal, and reserve the other half for topping. Add other desired toppings, and mwah! Delicious."
