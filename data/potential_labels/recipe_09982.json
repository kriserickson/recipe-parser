    "First prepare falafel by following this recipe. You will only need 12 falafel, which is about 1/2 of the recipe. I like to make a batch ahead of time and keep them uncooked in my freezer so I just have to slightly thaw and pan-fry them when I want a Mediterranean Bowl! This keeps prep/cook time under 30 minutes.",
    "Prepare the parsley salad by adding parsley, tomato, onion, lemon juice, salt and olive oil (optional) to a medium mixing bowl and tossing to combine. Set aside.",
    "To serve, divide salad greens and parsley salad between two serving bowls and top with hummus, olives, 6 falafel each and tahini sauce. I also prefer some fresh lemon juice and chili garlic sauce.",
    "Best when fresh!"
