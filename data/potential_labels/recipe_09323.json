    "Halve the peeled onions lengthwise from top to bottom, then slice into thin slices, also from top to bottom (in the same directions as the lines as opposed to across). This technique enables them to cook faster.",
    "Heat the oil in a pan and fry the sliced onions until they are a deep golden colour. Add the garlic-chilli paste and fry for 1-2 minutes.",
    "Add the dry spices to the onions and cook for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Add the chopped tomatoes, tamarind, grated ginger, salt and water.",
    "Cook on a rapid simmer for 5-7 minutes until the sauce has reduced and thickened.",
    "Add the prawns and curry leaves (if using) and cook until the prawns are cooked through, 3-4 minutes for fresh prawns and 5-7 minutes for frozen. Serve with poppadoms and rice."
