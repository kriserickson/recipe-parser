    "Put the onion, garlic, ginger and chilli into a small food processor and blend to a paste. Heat 1 tsp oil in a large pan and fry the paste for a few minutes with a pinch of salt, then add the spices, and fry for another minute before adding the squash and chickpeas. Mix with the spices, then add the coconut milk and stock. Bring to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes until the squash softens and the sauce thickens. Stir in the spinach until wilted, and squeeze in the lime juice to serve."
