    "Most Important - try to wipe out ALL of the oil. Use a different t-shirt or towel. I do a two step wipe, the first with a towel, the second with a paper blue Shop Towel. You won't be able to get it all and there's enough left on the pan for the seasoning.",
    "Return to oven and heat to 300. Once it's 300, take out and wipe down again. Note I don't actually do this step anymore, but I recommend it to newbies or people having problems with their own process. It helps make sure all of the excess oil is removed.",
    "Return to oven and heat to 450",
    "Bake for an hour",
    "Let cool in oven (completely if you're finished and have time. You can go to 200 if you're going to do another round of seasoning and are in a rush)",
    "Repeat process starting at step 3.",
    "Do this 2 or 3 times and you'll get a well seasoned pan."
