    "Make the tomato sauce: Heat the olive oil over medium in a medium saucepan. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant about 3 minutes. Using a fork, smash the garlic cloves and add in the diced tomatoes, parsley, chile flakes, cayenne, garlic powder, dried oregano, bay leaves, fresh oregano, and basil and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, sugar, salt, and pepper and bring to a low simmer. Cook, covered, for 30 minutes.",
    "Cook the shrimp: Place the eggs in a medium bowl and the flour and breadcrumbs in another bowl. Add about a tablespoon of black pepper to the breadcrumb mixture. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and, working in batches, dredge the shrimp in the eggs, then in the flour and breadcrumb mixture.",
    "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, cook the shrimp, flipping once, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Squeeze some lemon juice over the shrimp.",
    "Heat the oven to 350Â°F. In a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish, spread a thin layer of sauce. Spread an even layer of shrimp over the sauce and top with a bit of both cheeses. Top with about 1 to 2 cups more sauce and more shrimp. Top with more cheese and some more sauce, then bake until golden, 40 to 45 minutes."
