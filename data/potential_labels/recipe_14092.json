    "Directions",
    "In a blender or food processor, combine lime juice, cilantro, coconut oil, garlic, salt, cumin, chili powder, honey, and water. Process until well blended. Arrange steak strips in a bowl or other dish. Pour marinade over them, and toss to coat all the pieces evenly. Cover dish and let sit for a few hours (best to prep this in the morning and let sit in the fridge all day).",
    "To cook: heat a little coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak strips to the skillet, and cook for about 2 minutes on each side. Strips are done when they are browned but still a bit pink on the inside."
