    "Season the chicken with a little salt and pepper.",
    "Heat up a skillet (cast-iron skillet preferred) on medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Pan-fry the chicken until both surfaces become crispy or nicely browned. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.",
    "Discard the chicken fat from the skillet. Add the remaining olive oil and saute the garlic until light brown. Add the chicken back into the skillet, follow by the chicken broth, white wine and yogurt. Lower the heat and let simmer. Add the thymes (if using), salt, pepper and paprika. Reduce the sauce a little bit. Remove from heat, garnish with parsley and serve immediately."
