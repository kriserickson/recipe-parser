    "Combine the first 8 ingredients; rub over both sides of pork chops. In a Dutch oven, brown chops in oil for 2-3 minutes on each side. Remove and set aside. In the same pan, saute onions and garlic for 2 minutes. Add carrots and broth. Bring to a boil; reduce heat.",
    "Return chops to pan. Cover and bake at 325° until meat and vegetables are tender, 1-1/2 to 2 hours. If desired, thicken pan juices. Serve with potatoes and if desired, top with chopped fresh thyme. Freeze option: Cool pork mixture. Freeze in freezer containers. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Heat through slowly in a covered skillet until a thermometer inserted in pork reads 145°, stirring occasionally."
