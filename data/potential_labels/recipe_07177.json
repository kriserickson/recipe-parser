    "Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion and chile and sauté for about 2 minutes. Add the remaining garlic, the beans, the corn, the broccoli and the rice, if using. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until corn is bright yellow and broccoli is bright green. Stir in parsley, paprika, salt and pepper and continue to cook for about a minute. Adjust seasonings if needed.",
