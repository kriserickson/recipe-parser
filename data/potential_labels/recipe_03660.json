    "Combine cornmeal, flour, onion, salt, egg and milk. The batter should be just wet enough that you can shape it into balls about the size of a walnut with your hands and it sticks together. Have oil hot in a skillet and drop hush puppies into oil. Cook about 3 to 4 minutes browning on all sides. Remove and drain on paper towels. This makes about 10 to 12 hush puppies. You can double or triple the recipe. Enjoy!"
