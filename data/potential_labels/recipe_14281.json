    "Heat your oven to 350F (180C).",
    "Prepare your sides so they are good to go, because this recipe comes together pretty quickly. Slice the avocado and lime, roughly chop the cilantro, and spoon the salsa and refried beans into bowls.",
    "Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil, and pop them in the oven for 15-20 minutes until heated through.",
    "Chop the peppers, onions, and mushrooms into thick slices. Finely mince the garlic.",
    "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Toss in the peppers, onions, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, and salt. Stir to keep anything from burning. Cook for about 5 minutes until the veggies just being to soften.",
    "Add in the mushrooms and garlic and continue to cook for another 5-7 minutes until everything is just cooked. Crank the heat for the last minute if you want to get a real sizzle going on.",
    "Bring the skillet directly to the table for added fun, and rest on something so it doesn't burn your table. Dig in!"
