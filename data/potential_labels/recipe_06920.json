    "Place butter in a bowl with lemon zest or herbs and mix to combine. Spread bread slices with the lemon or herb butter and then trim off the crusts. Cut each slice into 4 squares. The bread can be prepared in advance to this stage and covered with a moist paper towel until needed.",
    "Just before serving, drain brine from oysters and discard. Add vinegar or lemon juice to oysters and stir gently to coat. Place an oyster on top of each piece of bread, season with a little freshly ground black pepper and serve at once."
