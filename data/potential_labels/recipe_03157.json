    "Rinse and drain the black beans then add to a large bowl. Add the olive oil.",
    "With a fork or potato masher, mash the beans until fairly smooth – I left some whole beans for texture.",
    "Add the rest of the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly.",
    "Add the water, soy sauce and liquid smoke and using a wooden spoon stir to combine.",
    "Using your hands, begin to knead the dough, bringing together all the wheat gluten and bread crumbs.",
    "Tip the dough onto a clean work surface and knead for approximately 3-5 minutes to develop the gluten strands.",
    "Roll into a big ball and flatten slightly. Using a knife, cut off strips before rolling with your hands into sausage shapes.",
    "Repeat with the remaining dough (I ended up with 8 sausages)",
    "To cook, heat a small frying pan with 1/2 tbsp olive oil on a medium heat, cook for 1-3 minutes each side or until crispy and well browned.",
    "If you wish to, you can freeze the leftover sausages!"
