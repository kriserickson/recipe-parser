    "Boil the brown rice according to the instructions on the packet.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large wok and add the garlic and mixed vegetables. Cook over a medium heat, stirring often.",
    "While the vegetables are cooking, combine the pineapple juice, soy sauce, rice vinegar, agave nectar and a little black pepper in a jug, and mix well.",
    "When the vegetables are just tender (don't overcook them), add the pineapple chunks, cashews and black beans (if using), along with the sauce. Continue to cook for a couple of minutes longer until everything is warmed through.",
    "Drain the brown rice and add it to the stir fry (or serve them alongside each other if you prefer), and serve topped with some fresh coriander."
