    "Heat the oil in a large skillet and brown the sausage meat, breaking it up into small pieces. When starting to brown, add the frozen corn (no need to thaw), onions, bell peppers and jalapenos. Season with the chili powder, salt, red pepper flakes and plenty of black pepper. Cook until the vegetables are crisp-tender.",
    "Add the rice and stir-fry until heated through and coated with the vegetable mixture. Add the Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and lime zest and juice. Stir-fry until the rice is just starting to brown. Add the scallions and stir well so that they are thoroughly mixed in. Serve and garnish with cilantro.",
