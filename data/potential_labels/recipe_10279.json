    "In a small bowl, combine the butter, garlic, lemon juice, and parsley; mix well. Place the mixture down the center of a 12-inch-square piece of waxed paper and roll into a 1-inch-thick log. Wrap tightly and refrigerate about 2 hours, or until firm.",
    "Preheat the broiler. Season each side of the steaks with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Place steaks on a broiler pan or rimmed baking sheet and broil 7 to 9 minutes.",
    "Turn the steaks over and place four (1/4-inch) slices of herbed butter on each steak; broil 7 to 9 minutes for medium-rare, or until desired doneness. Top each serving with an additional 1/4-inch slice of herbed butter and allow to melt. Store any unused herbed butter in the refrigerator for future use."
