    "Preheat oven to 350F, with rack on lower middle position.",
    "In a large heavy skillet, heat oil on medium high. Cook onion and garlic until fragrant, about 3 minutes, stirring often. Remove from heat and set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, combine ground turkey, breadcrumbs, egg, ¼ cup of the BBQ/ketchup sauce, salt, and pepper. Add the onion/garlic mixture. Stir well to fully incorporate.",
    "In a large baking pan (I use a 9x13) use your hands to form meatloaf into a rectangle, about 8x4 inches. Reserve 2 TB of BBQ/ketchup sauce on the side. Brush remaining sauce on top and all around the meatloaf.",
    "Bake uncovered for 50 minutes. Let sit at room temp for 5 minutes. Brush with reserved 2 TB sauce on top. Garnish with parsley if desired. Gently slice and serve."
