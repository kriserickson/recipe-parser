    "Chop your asparagus into 1 inch pieces. Blanch them for about 45 seconds in a pot of boiling, salted water. Remove immediately and transfer asparagus to a bowl of ice water. Let cool, then drain. (If you’re using fresh peas, blanch the peas as well, if you’re using frozen ones, just let them thaw and add them to your salad raw).",
    "In a large bowl toss together the asparagus, peas, salad greens, chickpeas, radishes and mozzarella. Add as much of the dressing as you like and toss again. Add pistachios, chives and mint. Taste and adjust seasonings. Transfer the salad to a platter and serve.",
    "This salad can be made up to a day in advance, just leave out the salad greens until you’re ready to serve."
