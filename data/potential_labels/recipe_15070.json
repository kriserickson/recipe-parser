    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "Roast pumpkin or butternut squash. (I start by putting mine in the oven for a few minutes to soften so it's easier to cut). Cut in half and scoop out the insides (save & toast the seeds if you want). Drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper and roast cut side up for 20 minutes, flip and roast cut side down for 20-30 or until the flesh is soft. Remove from oven, let cool, then peel the skin away from the flesh.",
    "While the squash roasts, slice the apple and onion into wedges and arrange on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast for 20 minutes or until the edges turn golden brown. During the last 10 minutes or so, add the whole garlic cloves to the baking sheet.",
    "In a blender, add pumpkin mash, roasted onion, apple, garlic (remove the skins), coconut milk, ginger, cardamom, cayenne and salt. Puree until smooth. If it's too thick, add a bit of water or broth to thin and blend again. Taste and adjust seasonings. Store leftovers in the fridge for up to a few days."
