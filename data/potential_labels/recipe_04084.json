    "Preheat the oven to 220°C, 200°C fan, Gas mark 5.",
    "Mix together meat, breadcrumbs, egg and half the onion. Shape the mix into little meatballs of around 5cm diameter. The mix should make 18 balls. Press mini mozzarella into the center of each meatball and seal it inside.",
    "Grease a baking sheet with 1 tbsp of Flora Cuisine, and bake the meatballs in the oven for about 10 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile make the sauce. Heat the remaining Flora Cuisine and fry the rest of the onions and Knorr Garlic Flavour for 5 minutes until soft. Add 200ml of water, the Knorr Beef Stock Pot and tomatoes. Bring to a boil and simmer gently for 5 minutes.",
    "Add the meatballs to the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and simmer covered for about 10 more minutes. Serve topped with grated cheese."
