    "In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder and salt. In a small measuring cup, whisk together the milk, oil and vanilla. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a fork until moistened. Stir in the blueberries.",
    "Spoon the batter into a 12–16-ounce (450–473ml) mug. Sprinkle the top with nuts. Microwave on high until the cake has expanded and is firm to the touch, 1 1/2–2 minutes, depending on the wattage of your microwave. Watch closely and do not overcook. Add time in 10-second intervals if the muffin is not done. The muffin will puff up at first, but deflate as it cools."
