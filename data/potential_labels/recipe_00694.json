    "For the teriyaki sauce: Combine the cornstarch in cold water and dissolve. Set aside.",
    "Mix soy sauce, pineapple juice, brown sugar, grated ginger and garlic in small saucepan over medium-low heat; bring to a boil and simmer until sauce reduces, about 15 to 18 minutes. Add cornstarch water mixture and simmer until thick, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.",
    "For the shrimp:",
    "Dry shrimp well with a paper towel then place the shrimp in the food processor along with garlic then pulse a few times until almost pasty. Combine the shrimp in a large bowl with remaining ingredients and mix well to combine. Using rubber gloves (easier with gloves), form shrimp into 8 patties. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or as long as overnight.",
    "Heat the grill over medium-high heat and brush the grates with oil. Add the shrimp burgers to the heated grill and cook 6 minutes on each side. While the shrimp burgers are cooking, grill the pineapple slices for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side.",
    "To serve, place a piece of lettuce on the bottom of each burger bun. Top with the cooked burger and 1-1/2 tbsp of teriyaki sauce, then top with grilled pineapple."
