    "Place a large Dutch oven, or heavy bottom pot, over medium-high heat;",
    "-Once the pot is hot, add in a small drizzle of olive oil, and the chopped bacon; crisp the bacon completely until nice and brown, then remove with a slotted spoon, drain it on some paper towel, and set it aside for a moment; reserve about 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat, and set that aside for a moment, as well; wipe out the pot, and return it to medium-high heat.",
    "-Next, add back into the pot the bacon fat, along with the olive oil and the butter, and allow them to melt together;",
    "-Once butter is melted and sizzling, add in the diced onion, carrots and celery, and allow them to soften and saute for about 5 minutes;",
    "-Next, add in the garlic, and once it becomes aromatic, add in about 2/3 of the reserved, crisped bacon, as well as the Italian seasoning, the sea salt and the pepper, along with the white beans, and stir to combine;",
    "-Now add in the hot chicken stock, stir, and allow the stew to gently simmer for about 40-45 minutes, partially covered with lid;",
    "-About half way through the cooking process, mash the beans a little bit with the back of your spoon, or with a potato masher, to break up the beans a little bit and release their natural starch to thicken the stew;",
    "-After about 40 minutes, turn the heat off and finish the stew by adding in the chopped parsley, the lemon zest and the lemon juice;",
    "-Serve the stew with some nice, crusty bread to dip, and garnish with some of the remaining crisped bacon."
