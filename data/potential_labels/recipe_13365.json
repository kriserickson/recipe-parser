    "Soak the lentils and beans for at least eight hours, and preferably overnight.",
    "Meanwhile, make your dressing – a good steeping in oil and acid will calm the chilli and garlic and meld the flavours. Put the garlic and chilli into a lidded jar and pour over the oil and some of the lemon zest and juice. Screw on the lid tightly and shake vigorously to emulsify. Unscrew, taste and adjust with more lemon, if needed.",
    "When you’re ready to make the salad, thoroughly rinse the lentils and beans and put them in a pan of unsalted cold water. Bring to the boil, scrape off any scum and boil vigorously for 10 minutes. Reduce to a simmer and cook for a further 30 minutes, or until tender. Drain and rinse.",
    "Meanwhile, warm the dressing in a small saucepan over a low heat.",
    "Toss the other salad ingredients together with the pulses – there is no need to cook the kale. Add the dressing to taste and serve."
