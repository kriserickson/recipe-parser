    "In a small bowl combine the 1/2 cup water, soy sauce, salt, brown sugar, onion powder, liquid smoke, black pepper, and chili powder. Pour the mixture over the chicken breasts and marinate overnight. You can marinate for less time if you wish, but overnight is much better.",
    "Cook the chicken on your barbecue or indoor grill over medium/high heat for 5 to 6 minutes per side, or until done. Slice the chicken into bite-size chunks.",
    "While the chicken cooks, prepare the rice following the instructions on the box. It will probably tell you to bring the water to a boil, then add the rice, stir, cover, remove from the heat, and let it sit for 5 minutes.",
    "When the rice is cooked, add the enchilada sauce and salt to the saucepan. Put the rice over low heat, uncovered, and cook until hot.",
    "Heat the tortillas in a steamer, or wrap them in moist towels and heat on high for 25 to 30 seconds in the microwave.",
    "Build a burrito by spreading 1/4 of the chicken down the middle of one of the tortillas. Leave room at the ends for folding.",
    "Spread 1/3 cup of rice over the chicken.",
    "Sprinkle a heaping tablespoon of each of the cheeses over the rice.",
    "Fold the left side of the tortilla over the filling, then fold up the bottom of the tortilla. Finish the burrito by folding the right side over and serve hot. Repeat for the remaining burritos. You may want to heat up each burrito in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds to help the cheeses melt.",
    "Makes 4 burritos."
