    "In a large bowl, combine shredded zucchini, corn, green onions, chickpea flour, garlic, cumin, oregano, thyme, salt & pepper. Stir together until well combined. Allow to sit for at least 5 minutes. This step is important because the flour will absorb the moisture from the zucchini and create a batter.",
    "Warm a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Grease with preferred cooking oil then scoop out 1/4 cup of the zucchini mixture at a time into the skillet. Cook for about 3-5 minutes on each side, until light golden brown."
