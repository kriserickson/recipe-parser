    "Instructions",
    "Cut your chicken into slices and add to a pot over medium-high heat.",
    "Add broth, garlic powder [or fresh garlic!] and cumin and bring to a boil.",
    "Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked thoroughly, about 10 minutes.",
    "While the chicken cooks, use a spiralizer to transform your zucchini into tasty noodles.",
    "Once the chicken is ready, add zucchini noodles and lime juice to the soup and simmer for an additional 3 minutes until desired tenderness is reached. For softer noodles, feel free to cook them a tad longer.",
    "Transfer soup to two large bowls and top each with fresh cilantro and a hearty drizzle of Sriracha chili sauce. Add a little, or a lot! I go nuts with mine, the garlic chili sauce flavor is fantastic with the tender chicken and savory broth. Serve with lime wedges for a burst of citrus flavor.",
    "Dive in while it's hot!"
