    "Melt lard in cast iron dutch oven, or very heavy bottomed pot with lid, over medium high heat.",
    "Salt and pepper all sides of pork roast.",

    "DO NOT move it for a minute or so, then rotate it to brown all sides.",
    "Lay garlic cloves and onion slices around the roast and stir to brown them a bit.",
    "Mix Kitchen Bouquet into the 2 cups of water.",
    "Pour in the water mixture.",
    "Bring to a boil.",
    "Cover tightly and place in lower portion of the oven.",
    "Roast 1 hour for boneless roast; 1-3/4 hours for bone-in roast.",
