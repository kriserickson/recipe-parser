    "For the syrup:",
    "Carefully slice the vanilla beans in half lengthwise, from tip to tip, and scrape the tiny seeds into a small saucepan, adding the halved vanilla beans as well. Add the water and granulated sugar.",
    "Bring to a simmer, then continue to cook for an additional 3 minutes, or until all of the sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat, add vanilla extract, and allow to cool completely.",
    "Carefully pour it all into a clean jar, including the vanilla beans (they will continue to infuse the syrup), and refrigerate for up to 1 month. To make each glass of cream soda, add 1-1/2 tablespoons vanilla bean syrup to 10 ounces of seltzer water, or to taste.",
    "Makes 1 cup of syrup.",
    "Notes:",
    "Once you've used up the syrup, don't discard the vanilla beans; instead allow them to dry out, and try one of these creative uses for leftover vanilla beans."
