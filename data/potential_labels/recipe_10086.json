    "Mix dry ingredients together in a small bowl to create blackening powder. Then moisten the sides of each tilapia filet (either with water or cooking spray), and coat with blackening powder. (I generally use about 1 Tbsp. powder per filet.)",
    "Heat 1 Tbsp. of oil per filet in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once oil is almost smoking, add filets and cook for about 3 minutes per side, or until fish is opaque and can be flaked with a fork. Remove from pan and serve immediately."
