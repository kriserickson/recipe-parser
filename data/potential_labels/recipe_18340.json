    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic; cook a few minutes or until the onion becomes softened.",
    "Next stir in cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, cayenne; cook for 30 seconds to a minute until spices are fragrant. Add tomatoes, broth, chickpeas, butternut squash, lentils, and salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes or until butternut squash is tender and lentils are fully cooked.",
    "Stir in lemon juice and sprinkle with cilantro and basil, if desired. Serve with a dollop of yogurt if you aren't vegan. Makes 4 servings - about 2 cups each.",
    "NOTES",
    "Instead of butternut squash, you can use sweet potatoes or acorn squash.",
    "I like to buy already-cut up butternut squash for ease; you can usually find it at Trader Joe's."
