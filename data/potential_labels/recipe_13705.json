    "Preheat oven to 375F/190C. Slice the bacon. Cut the core out of the cabbage and cut it into thin strips. (We used a mandoline slicer to slice the cabbage.) Mince the onion.",
    "Heat a small frying pan over medium high heat, add the strips of bacon, and cook until the bacon is browned and very crisp. Drain bacon on paper towels.",
    "Heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil (or a little bacon fat if you prefer) in the largest frying pan you have, add the minced onion, and cook over medium-high heat until it's barely starting to brown. Add the sliced cabbage, season with paprika, salt, and pepper, and cook just until it has softened partly. Then add the crisp bacon pieces, stir to combine with the cabbage, and cook 1-2 minutes more to combine flavors.",
    "Spray a glass baking dish with olive oil or non-stick spray. (The oval glass dish I used was 13\" x 10\" at the widest parts.) Put the sauteed cabbage in the casserole dish and spread the sour cream over, then sprinkle with the grated Mozzarella.",
    "Bake about 30 minutes, or until it's bubbling hot and the top is nicely browned. Serve hot."
