    "Put the 1 gallon water in a large pasta pot, season it with salt and bring it to a boil over medium heat.",
    "Add the oil and pancetta to a large saute pan over low heat. Cook the pancetta until crisp, being careful not to burn it, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and stir for 5 seconds. Add the wine, cream and black pepper. Cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Drop the fresh linguine into the water and stir to separate strands. When the pasta is just undercooked, remove it from the water and add it to the saute pan with the sauce. Gently stir for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat, add 1/2 cup of the cheese and the egg whites and stir, being careful not to break the noodles. Add the egg yolks and lightly toss. Transfer the pasta to a serving bowl or platter and garnish with the remaining cheese. Enjoy."
