    "Put the rice into a large bowl and wash it in several changes of water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and put in a heavy pot with the water and bring to a boil. Continue boiling until most of the surface liquid has evaporated. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes. The surface of the rice should have small indentations like a pitted crater.",
    "At this point, cover the pot with a very tight-fitting lid, turn the heat as low as possible and let the rice cook undisturbed for 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "There is no need to fluff the rice before serving it."
