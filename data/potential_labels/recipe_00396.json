    "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Stem and chop kale. Toss kale with 1 tablespoon feta marinade, spread in even layer on aluminum foil-lined baking sheet, and roast until crisp and lightly browned at edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Rinse quinoa and chickpeas; combine with roasted kale, remaining 2 tablespoons marinade, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in 8-inch square baking dish.",
    "Grate lemon for 1 teaspoon zest, then squeeze for 2 teaspoons juice. Microwave zest and 1 1/2 cups water in covered bowl until just boiling, about 2 minutes. Pour hot water over quinoa mixture and cover dish tightly with double layer of foil. Bake until quinoa is tender and no liquid remains, 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "Core and finely chop tomatoes. Remove dish from oven and fluff quinoa with fork. Gently fold in tomatoes and lemon juice and sprinkle with feta. Continue to bake casserole, uncovered, until feta is heated through, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve."
