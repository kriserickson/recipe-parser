    "Prepare the dry rub by combining the paprika, garlic powder, dry mustard and sea salt in a bowl.",
    "Rub the pork roast all over with the spice rub and place in the refrigerator for the flavors to penetrate the meat for a minimum of 1 hour, but up to overnight. If marinating only for 1 or 2 hours, leave the roast at room temperature to marinate.",
    "Preheat your oven to 300 F.",
    "Place the marinated pork shoulder or butt in the oven in a baking pan for about 6 hours, until the meat is almost falling apart and is very fork tender.",
    "While the pork is cooking, prepare the sauce by combining together the apple cider vinegar, ketchup, mustard, garlic, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper in a small pot or saucepan.",
    "Gently bring to a simmer, stirringÂ occasionally, and simmer for about 10 minutes.",
    "When the pork roast is ready, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes.",
    "Pull the meat apart from the roast with two forks and place the meat shreds in a bowl.",
    "Combine the spicy sauce with the pulled pork and serve the delicious and tender meat with your favorite side of salad."
