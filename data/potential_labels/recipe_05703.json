    "Take 1 tortilla. Spread it with the guacamole and Philadelphia Light. Squeeze over some lemon juice and finally add the salsa. Take another tortilla and sandwich it on top of the one with all the filling on. Repeat this with the next 2 tortillas. You will be left with two pancake sandwiches or 'quesadilla'.",
    "Then take a frying pan and heat until warm. Place one quesadilla in it and brown for 3-4 minutes on one side and then turn over and do the same. Repeat with the second quesadilla.",
    "Cut each one into triangle size pieces and serve hot. Incredible as a meal or great to have as nibbles with drinks! Serve ona plate and garnish with coriander leaves."
