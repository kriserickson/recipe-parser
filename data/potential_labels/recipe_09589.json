    "Preheat oven to 400. Lay bacon on foil covered sheet pan and bake for 12-15 mins; set aside to drain on paper towel. Reduce oven heat to 350. Chop onions and put on the baking sheet in the bacon grease. Broil onions on high for 5 mins. Chop sausage and add to a greased baking dish. Mix eggs and cream together until completely combined. Add the salt and pepper to your liking. Poor egg mixture over sausage and then add in your onions. Cover with half of the cheese and then top with all your crumbled (or chopped) bacon. Top with remainging cheese. Bake on 350 for 30 mins! Let cool for 5 mins before slicing or scooping! Top and serve with a dollop of sour cream or mayo! Enjoy!"
