    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 8x8 inch pan with nonstick cooking spray.",
    "In a large bowl of electric mixer or food processor, cream together peanut butter, honey, vanilla and applesauce until smooth. Add cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt; mix again until smooth. Gently fold 1/4 cup of chocolate chips into batter. Pour batter into prepared baking pan and smooth top. I usually spray my spatula with cooking spray to help spread it out evenly. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips over the top.",
    "Bake for 18-22 minutes or until top is just set. It's okay if they look a little underdone; we want these to be fudgy! Plus they are vegan so you don't need to worry about them cooking all the way through. Cool on wire rack as long as you can. Cut into 12 delicious squares!"
