    "Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Lightly grease a 6 cup jumbo muffin tin.",
    "Whisk together the coconut oil, applesauce and honey OR agave in a medium sized bowl. Beat in the eggs and whisk until fully combined. Whisk in the buttermilk and yogurt and set aside.",
    "In a large separate bowl, stir together all dry ingredients except for the blueberries. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Don't overmix, a few lumps are OK!",
    "Gently fold the blueberries through the batter with a spatula. You only want to give this 3-5 stirs because else you'll end up with an overmixed batter and grey muffins.",
    "Evenly divide the batter between the six jumbo muffin cups. If you want to you can now sprinkle the tops of the muffins with a bit of brown sugar to make the tops extra golden and crispy.",
    "Reduce the oven temperature to 400°F (205°C) and bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350°F (180°C) and finish baking for 15 minutes. The muffins should be nicely dome-shaped now with golden brown tops and baked through the center.",
    "Remove the muffins from the oven and allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing them from the pan and completely cooling on a wire rack."
