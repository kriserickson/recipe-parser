    "Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (177°C). Melt butter in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat, then add onion, bell pepper, sugar, sage, salt, paprika, and cayenne. Cook, stirring, until onions are translucent and just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes, then add corn. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until no water remains in skillet, another 8 to 10 minutes, then stir in cornmeal and remove from heat.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and cream, then pour into corn mixture. Stir well to combine, sprinkle with cheese, and bake until softly set, about 20 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil only until lightly browned, just a minute or two more."
