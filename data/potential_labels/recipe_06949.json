    "Cooking Directions:",
    "Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry with paper towels. Trim fat and cut into slices that are approximately 1/4-inch thick and 1 1/2 to 2-inches in length.",
    "Coat a large skillet well with cooking spray and heat until hot over medium-high heat; add chicken slices, season with salt and pepper as desired, and cook until lightly browned, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet and place in a bowl; set aside.",
    "Melt butter in same skillet; add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion has softened, about 3 to 4 minutes.",
    "Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring constantly, 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.",
    "Stir in the chicken broth, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce and paprika (if using dried parsley add it now). Bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until liquid has reduced somewhat and is slightly thickened.",
    "Return chicken and any accumulated juices to skillet.",
    "Stir in the sour cream and heat just until hot; do not allow sauce to boil at this point or it may curdle. Remove from heat and stir in the fresh parsley.",
    "To serve, ladle sauce over hot buttered noodles or rice.",
    "Makes 6 servings.",
    "*Use canned broth or dissolve 2 teaspoons chicken base or bouillon granules in 2 cups of water. I prefer and use Redi-Base brand soup bases available at www.redibase.com.",
    "**Low-fat sour cream can be used.",
