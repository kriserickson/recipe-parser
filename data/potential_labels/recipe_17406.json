    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "Pre-heat oven to 325°F. Line a large jelly roll pan with aluminum foil. Spray the foil with non-stick cooking spray and then line the pan with saltine crackers.",
    "Place the butter and sugar in a medium sized pot over low medium-low heat. Stir until the butter is melted. Once the butter has melted, bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Stir constantly.",
    "Once it’s nice and bubbly and changed to more of a caramel color, remove pan from heat and pour evenly over saltine crackers. Spread mixture with a knife… however it doesn’t have to be perfect. Try to move fast during this part so the toffee doesn’t harden.",
    "Place pan in the oven and bake for 7-9 minutes. The mixture will spread evenly over the crackers as it bakes.",
    "Remove pan from and allow to cool slightly. Melt the chocolate and then pour over the top with a spatula. Sprinkle M&M’s (or nuts) on top and then place in the freezer for 15 minutes. Once chocolate has hardened break pieces off the foil and in an container. It will stay fresh for 1 – 2 weeks."
