    "Peel, cut in half, and thinly slice enough onions to fill a slow cooker half to three-quarters full.",
    "Sprinkle onions with the melted butter or olive oil and salt. Toss to coat.",
    "Cook for 10 hours on LOW. At this point, I found the onions had reduced from about 4 quarts raw to a little over 1 quart cooked onions and 1 1/4 cup liquid. To reduce further, leave the liquid in and cook for another 4 or 5 hours on LOW, stirring occasionally, until the onions are deeper brown and the liquid is almost completely cooked off.",
    "*Note: I used a 6 1/2-quart slow cooker. Adjust the recipe amounts to suit the size of your equipment."
