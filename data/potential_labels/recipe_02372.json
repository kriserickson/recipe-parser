    "Preheat oven to 350°. Coat a 2-quart casserole dish with nonstick spray.",
    "Cook beef in oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until brown, about 5 minutes, breaking up chunks with a potato masher. Drain fat from meat; return meat to skillet. Add eggplant, potatoes, onion, garlic, oregano, and cinnamon; simmer 15 minutes. Stir in wine; cook, uncovered, until liquid evaporates, 1–2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; simmer to reduce juices. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Melt butter for the béchamel in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour; cook 1 minute. Add milk, bring to a boil, and whisk until thickened. Remove pan from heat; add 1⁄2 cup Parmesan and nutmeg.",
    "Whisk eggs in a bowl and add some of the hot milk mixture to the eggs; whisk to combine. Whisk egg mixture into milk mixture in pan.",
    "To assemble, layer meat mixture in bottom of the prepared dish; top with béchamel. Sprinkle moussaka with 2 Tbsp. Parmesan and feta cheeses; bake until top is golden, 45–55 minutes. Remove moussaka from oven; allow it to cool on a rack for 20 minutes before serving."
