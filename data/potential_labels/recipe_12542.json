    "Why do these ingredients work?",
    "The vitamins and fiber found in cucumbers, along with its water content, makes you feel fuller and the more water you drink, the faster your metabolism will be. Cilantro or parsley are antioxidant-rich and tackle any water retention and bloating you might be facing while also helping in eliminating flatulence and acting as a blood tonic and blood purifier.[1] Both lemon and ginger are excellent digestive and detoxification aids that help burn your fat.",
    "Aloe vera, too, is rich in antioxidants and stimulates the metabolism – it also soothes any internal inflammation in the digestive tract, thereby making the digestive system more efficient.[2]",
    "So the bottom line is, this is a healthy drink that detoxifies you inside and out, aids in a healthier digestion, and also increases the metabolic rate – all in all, helping you to lose that stubborn fat much faster, as long as you couple it with a balanced diet and some regular exercise."
