    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil only the ramen noodles (no seasoning packet) for 2-3 minutes or until the noodles are al dente. Drain.",
    "Meanwhile heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and garlic and cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring often to ensure the garlic is not burning. You want to slowly caramelize the garlic in the butter. Add the ginger and miso paste and cook another minute. Add the zucchini and cook 2-3 minutes. Toss in the cooked ramen noodles and remove from the heat. Add the soy sauce and basil. Toss to combine. Divide the noodles among bowls and top with soft eggs and sesame seeds. Sprinkle with basil and cilantro (or cilantro flowers). EAT!"
