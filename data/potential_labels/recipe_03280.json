    "Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Spritz a 9 x 13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Set aside. Cook the spaghetti in salted water per the package directions until al dente. Drain well. On the stove top in a medium-size pot, cook the diced onion, mushrooms and celery in a couple of drizzles of olive oil. Cook for 5 minutes until the vegetables soften and are beginning to brown. Season with seasoned salt and black pepper to your taste. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute longer. Remove to a large mixing bowl."
