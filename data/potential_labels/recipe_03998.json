    "Preparation:",
    "In a pressure cooker, add the axone, tomato, green chilies, salt, and water and cook the mixture until the axone (soyabean boiled, fermented and either smoked or sun dried) is half-cooked. Add the sliced smoked pork/beef in the mixture and cook the mixture for 10 minutes. Strain out the water from the semi-soft rice, and add it into the axone and smoked meat mixture. Stir the whole mixture well and add water into it. The water level should be double the rice, smoked meat, and axone mixture level. Add the vegetable leaves into the mixture and stir again. Add salt if needed. Cover the cooker and pressure it for one whistle. Serve hot with ginger chutney."
