    "Strain the can of chickpeas, reserving the liquid in a large bowl, you should have about 3/4 C of brine. In the same bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the crap out of the brine. Once stiff peaks begin to form, gradually add in the sugar, being careful not to deflated the meringue. Add in the vanilla and mix until combined and you have stiff peaks (see top photo).",
    "If you would like to bake your meringues, pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees. Spoon the meringue onto 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Place both sheets in the oven, double stacking them so one tray is on the bottom rack and one of the top. Bake the meringues for 1.5 hours WITHOUT OPENING THE OVEN DOOR! Then let them cool for 2 hours in the oven, still no peaking. Opening the door will cause your meringues to deflate and we definitely don’t want that. After 2 hours remove them from the oven and carefully remove them from the parchment- they should come right off.",
    "Top with whipped cream and berries or chocolate or just eat ‘em plain, they’re delicious either way!"
