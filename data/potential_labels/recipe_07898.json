    "Combine dry ingredients, cinnamon and allspice in a large bowl and set aside.",
    "By now, your flax meal and water mixture should have a gelatinous texture. Dump it into a food processor with the dates, pumpkin, cider vinegar and coconut oil. Process until dates are roughly chopped.",
    "Fold the pumpkin mixture, the zucchini, nuts and berries into the dry ingredients.",
    "Scoop in to a greased muffin tin. (I always use an ice cream scoop to do this, as it makes super quick work of it!)",
    "These muffins are a great way to get some vegetables into kids without them knowing. Some people have even added cocoa powder successfully, or bananas…really, you can make substitutions in here however you like. Personally, I love chocolate-banana-zucchini muffins, but maybe I’m crazy. They’re great warm out of the oven with a bit of melted butter."
