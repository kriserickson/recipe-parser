Add chili bean\npaste; stir 30 seconds. Add 16 cups water,\nwhole green onions, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 2\ntablespoons salt, star anise, and rock sugar.\nMix in beef.

    "Ingredient tips: Chili bean paste\nis a spicy, fermented soybean paste. Star\nanise—a star-shaped seedpod—is available\nat some supermarkets. Chinese yellow\nrock sugar is made from raw sugar; it is\noften used in Chinese sauces and teas.\nDespite their name, Sichuan peppercorns\naren't related to regular peppercorns; the\nmildly hot dried berries, which resemble\nsplit peppercorns, come from the prickly\nash tree. Shandong la mian are Chinese\nwheat noodles. Look for these ingredients\nat specialty foods stores and Asian markets.",
