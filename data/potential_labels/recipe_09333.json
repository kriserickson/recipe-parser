    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
    "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, combine the oats, almond flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, coconut sugar and chocolate chips.",
    "In a large measuring cup, whisk together the cashew butter, maple syrup, rice milk, and vanilla.",
    "Pour the liquids into the dry ingredients and stir well to combine.",
    "Let the dough sit for at least 15 minutes.",
    "Using slightly damp hands, form the mixture into balls and flatten into about a 2.5 - 3 inch disc. This makes nice big cookies - just the way we like them. (You may have to re-dampen your hands as you go so the dough doesn't stick).",
    "Bake the cookies for 11-13 minutes until starting to brown. Let cool on the baking sheet for about 2 minutes before removing them to a cooling rack to continue cooling completely.",
    "Store leftovers on the counter, loosely covered with plastic wrap or foil."
