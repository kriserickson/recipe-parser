    "Scrub and rinse potatoes and pierce each with a fork two times. Place in oven and heat to 400 degrees (it doesn't need to be preheated) and bake 38 minutes. Remove and cool slightly then cool completely in refrigerator (I like to do this the night before and chill them overnight. If you cut them hot they crumble). Peel cooled potatoes if desired, then cut into 1/2-inch cubes.",
    "Heat reserved bacon drippings in a large skillet over moderately high heat, add potatoes and season with salt and pepper to taste and saute until golden brown, tossing only occasionally to get crisp sides.",
    "Meanwhile, in a blender or bowl blend together eggs and milk until combined. Pour into a buttered skillet over medium-low heat, season with salt and pepper to taste and cook and scramble eggs until set.",
    "To assemble tacos, spread a heaping spoonful of beans into a line down center of each flour tortilla, then pile on eggs, cheese, potatoes, bacon and salsa. Serve immediately.",
    "*For a shortcut here you can just use the frozen diced potatoes (regular or O'brien) and cook in bacon drippings according to directions listed on package.",
    "**If using canned refried beans, I recommend mixing a little water into them as they always seem to be super thick. For the homemade version see this recipe here just start with a low amount of water about 1/2 cup when blending then add more as needed and omit the cheese in that recipe. I used that recipe for these tacos.",
