    "Combine wet ingredients and beat well with a whisk. Whisk in dry ingredients until well combined. Drop 1/4 C dollops (or a little less) on a pre-heated, well greased griddle or in frying pan using a healthy fat (butter, ghee, coconut oil, etc.). Keep the pancakes small for ease of flipping. Flip pancakes when edges look sort of cooked. Cook second side, then serve with your choice of toppings.",
