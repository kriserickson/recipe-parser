    "Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Wash and chop the vegetables into approximately 1-inch pieces.",
    "Spread the vegetables out over a large baking sheet (or two, if needed) so they're in a single layer and not piled on top of one another. Drizzle the olive oil over top, then add the basil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the vegetables until they're evenly coated in oil and spices.",
    "Roast the vegetables for 30-40 minutes, stirring once or twice (every 15-20 minutes or so), until the vegetables are soft and browned on the edges. Taste the vegetables and add another pinch of salt if desired. Sprinkle fresh chopped parsley over top just before serving."
