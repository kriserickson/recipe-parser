    "***Note: Be careful when frying with hot oil! Place the pan on the back burner of the stove if you have kids in the house.",
    "In a separate bowl, mix together the egg and water.",
    "One at a time, assemble the wontons: use a knife to smear approximately 1/2 teaspoon Nutella on corner of a wonton wrapper, leaving a little bit of space from the corner. Use your finger to “paint’ the egg wash all around the edges of the wrapper. Roll the wrapper on a diagonal, starting with the Nutella corner and stopping when a little more than half the wrapper is rolled and the Nutella mixture is inside. Fold the two ends and use the egg wash to stick them together. Allow the remaining pointed end to naturally tuck backward. (The wontons should resemble tortellini.)",
    "As you work, place the assembled wontons under plastic wrap or a light towel to keep them from drying.",
    "Heat 2-3 inches of oil in a large saucepan or medium skillet to just under 350 degrees (you don’t want the oil too hot or it will burn the wontons! Experiment with a spare sheet of wonton wrappers to check.",
    "About 4 to 5 at a time, fry the wontons for about 45 seconds to 1 minute, flipping carefully midway through to make sure they brown evenly. Remove them when golden. Drain on a paper towel and dust generously with powdered sugar for serving. (Wait 3 to 4 minutes at least before eating since the Nutella will be hot.)"
