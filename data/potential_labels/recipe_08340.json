    "3",
    "... and the veal.",
    "4",
    "Steep the bread in cold milk...",
    "5",
    "... and strain. Add to the minced meat.",
    "6",
    "Using a knife, chop the garlic...",
    "7",
    "... and the parsley.",
    "8",
    "Add the chopped ingredients to the minced meat, as well as the whole egg and seasoning: salt, pepper and ground nutmeg.",
    "9",
    "Combine to get a homogeneous consistency.",
    "10",
    "Make an incision into the shoulder of lamb...",
    "11",
    "... to make a hole that is sufficiently big for the stuffing.",
    "12",
    "Season with salt and ground pepper.",
    "13",
    "Stuff the shoulder and sew both parts using a trussing needle...",
    "14",
    "... to maintain the stuffing in place.",
    "15",
    "Make sure not to leave any gaps.",
    "16",
    "In a casserole, heat the oil...",
    "17",
    "... and brown the lamb over low heat.",
    "18",
    "Slice the onion and cut the tomato into big cubes.",
    "19",
    "Using a fork, turn the lamb shoulder over and brown the other side.",
    "20",
    "Add the onion and tomato...",
    "21",
    "... and moisten with stock.",
    "22",
    "Season, cover the casserole with a lid and continue cooking over medium heat for about 1.5 hours. Stir the bottom of the pan regularly to prevent the meat from sticking. During the cooking process, add some more stock if necessary.",
    "23",
    "When the lamb is cooked, remove from the casserole.",
    "24",
    "Reduce the cooking juices.",
    "25",
    "Strain the sauce through a chinois, without pressing too much. Adjust the seasoning if needed. Serve the sauce with the lamb, in a separate recipient."
