    "Preparation",
    "Blackening Spice Mix",
    "Mix paprika, oregano, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, black pepper, and sugar in a small bowl to combine.",
    "Do Ahead: Spice mix can be made up to 1 month in advance. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.",
    "Crab Cakes",
    "Whisk egg in a medium bowl just to blend. Discard all but 2 Tbsp. beaten egg. Mix mayonnaise, parsley, ½ tsp. blackening spice, and a pinch of salt into remaining egg. Fold in crabmeat just until coated, taking care not to break it up too much.",
    "Divide crab mixture into 4 equal portions and, working with 1 portion at a time, pack tightly into ring mold set on a parchment-lined baking sheet; smooth top. Carefully remove ring mold. Repeat with remaining crab mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 1 hour (cakes will firm slightly when chilled).",
    "Do Ahead: Crab cakes can be formed 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.",
    "Mustard Sauce and Assembly",
    "Preheat oven to 400°. Melt 1 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium. Cook shallot, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking often, until just beginning to smell nutty, about 3 minutes. Whisk in wine, bring to a boil, and cook just until thick, about 1 minute. Whisk in broth, return mixture to a boil, and cook until thick enough to coat a spoon, about 5 minutes. Add cream, bring to a simmer, and cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture is again thick enough to coat a spoon, about 4 minutes. Whisk in mustard, cover sauce, and keep warm.",
    "Heat 1 Tbsp. oil and 1 Tbsp. butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Working with 2 crab cakes, sprinkle 1 tsp. breadcrumbs over each cake and carefully place, crumb side down, in skillet. Cook, occasionally swirling fat in pan around, until bottom sides of crab cakes are deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle 1 tsp. breadcrumbs over top sides of each crab cake, then very carefully turn over (you may need to use 2 spatulas as cakes will be very delicate). Cook until breadcrumbs are golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Wipe out skillet and repeat with remaining oil, butter, crab cakes, and breadcrumbs.",
    "After the second batch of crab cakes is done cooking, return crab cakes on plate to skillet and transfer to oven. Cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes.",
    "Serve crab cakes over mustard sauce topped with parsley."
