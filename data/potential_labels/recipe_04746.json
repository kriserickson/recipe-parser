    "In a large enough pan, add the butter and the olive oil, the sage leaves and the garlics with the skin on them. When the butter starts to sizzle add the chicken thighs skin side down and let them get golden brown over medium low heat. Turn them with a spatula without damaging the chicken and brown the other side. They will be cooking later so you just want to get the nice gold brown colour now.",
    "Heat the chicken stock.",
    "Remove the chicken from the pan, add the white wine and the cognac and deglaze the pan, scraping any pieces of meet stuck on the bottom. Let the alcohol evaporate completely, then add the mustard and dissolve in the sauce with a whisk.",
    "Add the chicken thighs to the pan, add the hot chicken stock to 2/3 of the hight of the chicken thighs. Season with salt and freshly ground white and black pepper and let simmer over low heat, covered, for 20 minutes.",
    "Remove the cooked chicken thighs and keep warm. Let the sauce simmer over low heat to reduce to as much as you will need for the 8 thighs. Squeeze the garlics and sage in the pan with the back of a wooden spoon or spatula to release more flavour, then discard them.",
    "Sift the flour and dissolve it in 3 tablespoons of cream using a whisk. Add the remaining cream and whisk. Now add a bit of hot sauce, whisk together very well and slowly pour in the pan, whisking well with all the sauce, over very low heat. Keep whisking so the sauce doesn't stick to the bottom.",
    "Let the sauce reduce again to the amount you need, always stirring. You will need about a cup of sauce to serve with the 8 chicken thighs.",
    "Pour the hot sauce over the chicken thighs and serve immediately with some potato mash."
