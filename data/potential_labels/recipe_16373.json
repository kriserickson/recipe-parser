    "In a glass dish or a sealable plastic bag, combine all the ingredients. Season with salt and pepper. Thoroughly coat the drumsticks with the marinade. Cover the dish or seal the bag and refrigerate for 2 to 8 hours.",
    "Preheat the grill, setting the burners to high. Oil the grate.",
    "Reduce the heat to low. Reserve the marinade and place the wings on the grill, turning them regularly, for 25 minutes, or until the meat pulls easily from the bone. Brush the wings with the marinade a few times during cooking.",

    "Make a few lengthwise incisions on each drumstick with the tip of a knife to allow the marinade to seep into the meat.Since this is a sweet marinade, the drumsticks will caramelize quickly. You may need to finish the cooking over indirect heat to prevent them from burning.",
