    "In a small bowl, mix dry ingredients (not carrots). If you have a blender (or Magic Bullet), mix all wet ingredients and blend. (Option for those without a blender: simply fork-mash the carrots very well before combining with the other wet ingredients.) Then mix dry into wet and stir. Pour into greased ramekins, a little dish, or a mug. (I used two 1/2-cup ramekins.) If using the microwave, cook for 1 minute 20 seconds (or more or less, depending on the strength of your microwave). Or you can cook this in the oven at 350F for around 15 minutes. Let cool before trying to pop out. Serves 1-2."
