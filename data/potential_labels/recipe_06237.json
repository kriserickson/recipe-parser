    "Sprinkle salt and pepper on each side of the pork chops. In a wide shallow dish, combine ¾ cup of flour with more salt and pepper. Dredge each pork chop into the flour mixture on both sides. Set aside on a plate. Preheat an iron skillet with oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat. Once butter melted, place each pork chop in the skillet, do not overlap. Brown each side until golden brown, about 3-5 minutes on each side. Once cooked, place pork chops onto a plate. Keeping the pan over the medium-high heat place in 1 tablespoon of butter. Sauté onions and mushrooms with Worcestershire sauce to taste and stir occasionally for 5 minutes. Add in the garlic and rosemary with 3 tablespoons of flour and give it a quick stir. Pour beef broth in over mushroom mixture and stir. It will begin to thicken while simmering for 5 minutes. Gently add in the Greek yogurt till combine. Turn off heat and place pork back into pan, mix with sauce, sprinkle parsley to top, and serve."
