In a separate bowl beat the Philly using an electric mixer until it’s smooth, beat in the sour cream then the eggs one at a time. Stir the leeks, chicken, tomatoes and oregano in and season to taste.",

Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the tin for 10 mins before gently running a pallet knife around the edge of the tin to release the cheesecake then undo the spring form and remove from the tin.
