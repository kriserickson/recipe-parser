    "Recipe Directions",
    "1. Place carrots in food processor by themselves. Process them very briefly - just to reduce them to littler chunks - about the size of pieces of popped popcorn. Leave carrots in food processor.",
    "2. Now add all cake ingredients into food processor. Process briefly and slowly, stopping to monitor the process. You want to get the texture seen in the above pictures - you want to be able to see small chunks of carrots, walnuts, etc. Do not over-process!",
    "3. Press cake down into a cake pan or square baking dish. Alternatively, you can shape the raw carrot cake mixture into a \"cake\" shape on a plate using your hands.",
    "4. Place all icing ingredients into a high-speed blender and blend until smooth.",
    "5. Ice cake.",
    "6. Refrigerate this raw carrot cake recipe for at least two hours. The cake and the icing will both harden up a bit in the fridge."
