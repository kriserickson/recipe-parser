    "Directions",
    "In a large frying pan, bring chicken broth to a boil. Add chopped chicken, onion, curry powder, and chili powder to broth, adding more broth as necessary. When chicken is fully cooked, add bell pepper, carrot, coconut milk, and honey. Simmer until bell pepper is cooked through.",
    "Serve over brown rice or quinoa with your choice of \"condiments.\" Our favorites are bacon, chopped bananas, raisins, chopped raw nuts, chopped hard-boiled eggs, and cilantro. We love the crunchy carrots, but for softer results cook carrots with the chicken in step 2.",
    "This is a super-quick meal--we find ourselves waiting on the rice every time!"
