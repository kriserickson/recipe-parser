    "To create your cucumber rolls, you’ll need a mandolin or a wide vegetable peeler. Slice the cucumber lengthwise, into very thin slices.",
    "Because they are so thin, you’ll want to double-up the slices for each roll",
    "Apply a thin layer of of hummus lengthwise down each slice.",
    "Then roll up, and top each roll with a dollop of tomato sauce!",
    "In a high-speed blender, blend all the ingredients until smooth and creamy.",
    "This makes a very thick, richly tomato-flavored sauce. Feel free to add more liquid, or adjust the ingredients, to suit your tastes!"
