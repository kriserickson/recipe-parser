    "For the raw, more authentic version, you basically add the rose petals and the sweetener in a glass jar and shake it well. Keep it in the sun for about 1-2 weeks stirring daily. This will be nicely sun-cooked and is very rich and robust in flavor.",
    "For the cooked version (which is simpler and much faster) you take a stock pot add the rose petals and the sweetener and cook it on a very low flame for about 15-20 mins, adding water as needed, making sure the petals are not getting burned.",

    "First blend the pumpkin seeds with some water and later add all the remaining ingredients and blend away to nice smoothie consistency."
