    "Heat the oil in a large heavy bottom sauce pan over medium-high heat, add the onion and cook until tender, about 3-5 minutes, before adding the garlic and cooking until fragrant, about a minute.",
    "Puree 1/3 of the potatoes and 1/3 of the corn into 1 cup of the chicken broth in a food processor.",
    "Add the broth, pureed veggies, the remaining potatoes, corn, carrots, oregano, thyme and bay leaves, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes and carrots are tender, about 20 minutes.",
    "Remove the bay leaves, add the lime juice, cilantro, miso, salt and pepper and enjoy garnished with aji picante, avocado, capers and sour cream!",
    "Slow Cooker: Optionally implement step 1, place everything from steps 1-3 into a slow cooker and cook on low for 6-10 hours or high for 3-5 hours before continuing with step 4.",
    "Option: * For the chicken feel free to use already cooked and shredded chicken or place chicken breasts, thighs or legs into the soup, cook with the soup, remove, shred and return to the soup. I like to poach a full chicken in the broth along with the cobs of corn after removing the kernels from them to infuse the broth with even more chicken and corn flavour!",
    "Note: Miso paste is not traditional but I like the added umami/flavour! Feel free to omit it or to replace it with a few splashes of fish sauce! Yum!",
    "Note: This is traditionally made with fresh guascas and papa criolla (andean potato) rather than with oregano, thyme and potatoes.",
    "Option: Serve with fresh arepa!"
