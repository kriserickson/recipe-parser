    "Start by measuring your heavy whipping cream into a bowl.",
    "Next, add your powdered sugar. Begin to whisk briskly.",
    "I quickly tired of whisking briskly and asked Chica if she had a container I could shake it in. She had this perfect little squeeze bottle that allowed me to quickly shake to the right consistency and then dispense the cream onto the top of my drink. What is the right consistency? Good question. You want it to thicken slightly, but still be loose. I shook this until when I squirted a little out of the bottle, it stayed in a nice circle on my finger tip. It only takes 10-20 seconds of vigorous shaking. You could also use a stand mixer or stick with the whisk and bowl if you need an arm workout.",
    "Once your cream topping is ready, add your vanilla butter nut flavoring to your cream soda and stir gently so you don’t get rid of all the carbonation in the soda.",
    "Pour your flavored cream soda into your Butterbeer mugs (if you made them) or into any chilled glass. Gently squirt on the whipping cream mixture so that it floats on top (or spoon it on if you don’t have a squirt bottle) in a layer about a half inch thick."
