    "Melt the butter (or a drizzle of oil if you want to be a bit healthier) in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, then tilt the pan so the butter coats the surface.",
    "Pour in 1 ladle of batter and tilt again, so that the batter spreads all over the base, then cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it starts to come away from the sides.",
    "Once golden underneath, flip the pancake over and cook for 1 further minute, or until cooked through.",
    "Serve straightaway with your favourite topping."
