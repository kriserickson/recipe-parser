    "Preheat fan-forced oven to 160C. Combine dates and water in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil. Add bicarbonate of soda and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Add butter and both sugars and cook for two to three minutes on low heat until sugar dissolves. Blend mixture with a stick blender and allow to cool slightly.",
    "Add eggs and flour and mix thoroughly. Place in a greased and lined 25-centimetre square cake tin and bake for 35-40 minutes. For butterscotch sauce, melt butter in a medium saucepan with sugars and golden syrup.",
    "Stir slowly and cook for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside for a few minutes. Stir in cream and continue to stir for four to five minutes to ensure sauce is smooth.",
    "Tip: This makes a large quantity but can easily be made in individual ramekins, too. Store the butterscotch sauce in a screw-top jar in the fridge for a couple of weeks."
