    "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Slice the mushrooms and put in a roasting tin with the gnocchi, then drizzle over 3 tbsp olive oil. Roast for 25-30 mins or until the gnocchi are golden, stirring occasionally to stop them sticking.",
    "Once the gnocchi are ready, stir half the spinach into the tin to wilt it, then crumble the blue cheese over the top. Put it back in the oven just to melt the cheese, then serve with the remaining spinach, drizzled with a little olive oil."
