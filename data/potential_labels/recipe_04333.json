    "Coat a 5- x 9-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.",
    "In a large saucepan over high heat, bring water and salt to a boil. Stir in oats and cook 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in brown sugar and raisins.",
    "Pour oat mixture into loaf pan, cover, and chill at least 6 hours, or overnight.",
    "Remove loaf from pan and cut into 1-inch-thick slices.",
    "In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Cook oatmeal slices 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until golden and heated through, adding more butter as necessary.",
    "Notes",
    "If you're eating this right away, serve topped with additional brown sugar or warm maple syrup.",
    "This is also a terrific make-ahead dish. When you're ready to serve it, you can just reheat a slice in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it's warmed through.",
    "You can even skip Step 5 and just microwave a slice when you're ready to enjoy it! This way, you can eliminate the butter."
