    "Line a round pizza pan with parchment paper. Scoop the sweet potato mixture onto the parchment paper and use a spatula to spread it into a large circle on the pizza pan. This process takes 5-10 minutes, so be patient as you're smoothing out the crust. When you're done, you should have a ½-inch thick pizza crust.",
    "Pop the pizza pan in the oven and bake for 25-35 minutes or until the crust is set and the edges are golden brown.",
    "Remove the crust from the oven and let cool.",
    "Add desired toppings (e.g., pizza sauce, vegan parmesan, artichokes, cherry tomatoes, basil) and return the pan to the oven and broil for 5 minutes.",
    "Slice, serve, and refrigerate leftovers."
