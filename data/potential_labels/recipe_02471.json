    "Whisk the eggs, maple syrup, vanilla seeds and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl.",
    "For the caramelised pecans, heat the sugar in a small pan until it turns a deep caramel colour (CAUTION: boiling sugar is extremely hot. Handle very carefully. Use a deep pan to avoid bubbling over.). Add the nuts and stir well to coat. Pour the mixture onto a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper. Leave to cool and harden for a few minutes, then chop into pieces.",
    "Melt 50g/1¾oz butter in a large non-stick frying pan. Dip the brioche slices into the egg mixture then pan fry in the butter for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.",
    "Heat the remaining butter in a non-stick pan and add the sliced pear, reserving four slices for a garnish. Add a tablespoon of sugar to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then add the chopped ginger and syrup. Cook for a further 1-2 minutes until the liquid has reduced and the pears have caramelised.",
    "Arrange the toasted brioche on four plates, top with the caramelised pears and fresh pear slices, crème fraiche and a squeeze of lemon and zest. Scatter with chopped pecans and dust with icing sugar."
