    "Heat the oven to 300 F (150 C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss the grapes and apples with 1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil and spread out on the baking sheet. Bake for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, stirring every half-hour or so until the grapes and apples are shrivelled and lightly caramelized. Remove from the oven and toss with the cinnamon and maple syrup.",
    "While the grapes are roasting, heat 2 Tbsp (30 mL) olive oil in pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until the onion is lightly browned. Reserve the onion.",
    "Bring the water to a boil in a large pot. Add the quinoa and 1 tsp. (5 mL) salt. When the water returns to the boil, continue cooking the quinoa at a simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Drain the water from the quinoa and return the quinoa to the pot. Cover and let sit over the lowest heat for 10-15 minutes until the quinoa is tender. Remove from the heat and let sit for 5 minutes longer.",
    "Fluff up the quinoa and toss with the grape mixture, onion, thyme and lemon zest. Season to taste. Transfer to a 9 x 13-inch (22.5 x 32.5) baking dish. Cool, cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.",
    "When ready to serve, cover the dish with foil or a lid and bake at 350 F (175 C) for 30-40 minutes, stirring half way through until hot. An instant-read thermometer should register 165 F (75 C) when inserted into the middle of the casserole. Sprinkle with the toasted almonds or pomegranate seeds and serve.",
    "Makes 8-10 servings"
