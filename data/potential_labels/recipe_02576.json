    "In a medium bowl, combine the chicken with the egg white, salt, and cornstarch. Stir until the cornstarch is fully dissolved. Let sit for 10 minutes.",
    "In a small pot, bring about 1 quart of water to boil. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil to the water. Add the chicken, and blanch for 1 minute, until the chicken is white on the outside but not cooked through. Drain the chicken well and set aside.",
    "In a wok or large skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped scallions and stir-fry briefly until aromatic, about 20 seconds. Add the chicken and frozen peas and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the soy sauce and sherry and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle in the almonds and stir so they are well-coated with the sauce. Transfer to a plate and serve."
