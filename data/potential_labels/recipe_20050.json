    "Position a rack in upper third of oven; preheat broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil.",
    "Step 2",
    "Halve peppers lengthwise and discard stems and seeds. Place the halves, cut-side down, on the prepared pan along with garlic.",
    "Step 3",
    "Broil, flipping often, until the peppers are charred in many spots, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a bowl and loosely cover with the foil. Let stand until cool enough to handle, about 20 minutes. Place the garlic on a small plate.",
    "Step 4",
    "Peel the peppers and garlic. Transfer the garlic to a food processor and add paprika, salt and cayenne; process to finely chop the garlic. Add the peppers and vinegar; process until pureed. With the machine running, slowly pour in oil through the feed tube. Let the sauce stand for 10 minutes before serving."
