    "Slice the veggies into 2 quart jars, I like to make layers of them: you can leave out the onions and peppers, if you want, but they are so good!~Mix your other ingredients in a large measuring cup, stir well. The sugar will not be dissolved yet~Pour over sliced vegetables, evenly in each jar~You will finish filling the jars with cold tap water~I shake the jar a few times during the 24 hrs to mix~No need to cook it~ Ready to eat in 24 hours. Taste best if eaten within a week or two~but I like to add tomato wedges or slices to this liquid for overnight, when it is close to empty of veggies~Use the next day~Unbelievable with sandwiches~"
