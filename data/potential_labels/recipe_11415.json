    "Deseed, peel the skin and dice into chunks.",
    "(You can either boil the diced pumpkin for 2 minutes in water, or in a non-stick pan cook with few drops of water with a lid on for 5 minutes - until it soft to mash. This is my preferred way, since it adds no extra water to the squash.)",
    "Leave the pumpkin mash to cool in the fridge for about 15 minutes before adding all the ingredients.",
    "Mix all the ingredients in a bowl, mash the pumpkin and make round balls golf ball size make them all before frying.",
    "Heat oil in a pan. As the pumpkin is not starchy like potatoes, keep them into balls and deep fry them until light brown, then take them out and put on a plate.",
    "Once they are cooled down press the balls down to flatten slightly, and serve with tamarind chutney. You could also add potatoes with the pumpkin, then you won't have to add the chick pea flour."
