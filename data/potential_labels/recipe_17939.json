    "Note: It is incredibly important to use a wooden spoon when making risotto. If you use a metal spoon the combination of heat and friction from the spoon and the pan will give your rice a metallic taste. Also make sure you buy the high quality saffron (around $10-$20 for a small bottle), not the cheap imitation stuff which won't give you the right flavor.",
    "Place saffron threads in a small dish and cover with 2 tbsp hot water. Let the saffron soak for a few minutes.",
    "In a medium saucepan, add your 6 cups vegetable stock and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat and keep the stock on a low simmer as you proceed with the recipe.",
    "In a separate large saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the rice and gently toast it in the oil. You're not really looking for color on the rice, you're just trying to get each grain nicely coated in oil.",
    "Add your shallots and cook until translucent. Deglaze the pan with white wine while stirring. Cook until the liquid has cooked down quite a bit, until the rice is almost dry and you can no longer smell the alcohol from the wine. If you look carefully you should be able to see streaks at the bottom of the pan as you stir. This is from the starch being released from the rice, and it's a good sign you're on the right track.",
    "Add enough of the hot stock from the saucepan to cover the rice completely and give it a stir. Turn up the heat on the rice until the rice is simmering throughout. Reduce the liquid until the rice is almost dry again, stirring frequently as it cooks down.",
    "Add more stock to barely cover the rice again, give a stir and let the liquid reduce about halfway, stirring frequently.",
    "Taste the rice for doneness. It should be about 75% of the way done at this point, but there is no hard and fast rule. Risotto is one of those dishes that relies on feeling and intuition more than a kitchen timer.",
    "Add your bloomed saffron/water, the butter and enough stock to barely cover the rice again.",
    "At this point you need to begin stirring constantly. You're trying to emulsify the fat, stock and starch while incorporating air. So, stir quickly and constantly until the rice has a nice, creamy, saucey look to it. You should be able to see those steaks at the bottom of the pan again. Taste the rice for doneness. If it's still not tender, add more stock and reduce it down to this saucey/starchy/creamy level again while constantly stirring.",
    "Once the rice is tender, add your Parmesan cheese while constantly stirring. Once it is thoroughly incorporated into the rice, stir in the chickpeas and remove from heat. Adding the chickpeas at this point will heat them thoroughly while bringing down the temperature of the rice enough that it wont overcook.",
    "Taste for seasoning. The cheese should bring enough salt to the dish, but if not add salt to taste. Serve immediately and garnish with chopped parsley."
