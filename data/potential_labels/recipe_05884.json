    "Place sprouts, evenly spaced and not stacked, on a baking sheet and place in a 400 degree oven for 40-45 minutes. Pull them out before they turn black but you definitely want them to be brown and crispy on the edges.",
    "NOTE: You can use fresh Brussels sprouts if you prefer, but I recommend halving them since they're often larger than frozen ones.",
    "Of course, adjust the salt and olive oil to taste."
