    "On a plate combine the last 4 ingredients. Rub the pork chops with olive oil and then dip (coat) each one in the cheese mixture. Press the mixture over the pork chops to make sure they are well covered in it. Line a pan with tin foil and spray with cooking spray. Place the pork chops on the pan and bake uncovered at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes.",
    "This works best if you flip 1/2 way through, or bake on a rack in the pan, so both sides are crispy."
