Add in half of the flour and baking powder and pulse a few more times until combine. Repeat with remaining flour and baking powder.",

    "In the same food processor (I just wipe/wash mine out while the falafel are baking), add the yogurt, feta, olive oil, salt, pepper and cayenne. Pulse and blend until combined, scraping down the sides if needed. I don't blend the feta completely because I like a bit of texture, but you can do so if you'd like. Scoop the feta into a bowl and give it an extra drizzle of olive oil. Garnish with the parsley and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper."
