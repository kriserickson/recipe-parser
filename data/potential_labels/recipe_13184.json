    "Remove the peels from the bananas and slice into 1/2 inch thick slices.",
    "Set a nonstick skillet over medium to medium high heat and add the oil or butter, honey, cinnamon, and salt. Lay down your banana slices, and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden and caramelized. Be sure to watch the heat and turn it down if it browns too quickly. You want enough heat to caramelize and brown the slices, but donâ€™t want them to burn."
