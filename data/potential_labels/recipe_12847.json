    "Cut the sour cream into your biscuit mix. \"Cutting in\" is simply incorporating your sour cream, butter or shortening into your dry baking mix without using a mixer. You can use a fork, knife, pastry cutter or the tools God gave you, your fingers. You just want to make sure that each portion of your {wet} ingredient gets coated with the dry mix.",

    "Knead and fold dough until coated with your baking mix. Pat dough out, (no rolling pin needed) and cut biscuits using a round biscuit/cookie cutter. Don't have one, no problem, you can certainly use a glass or empty soup can to cut out your biscuits. Where there's a will, there's a way! Improvising is fine.",
