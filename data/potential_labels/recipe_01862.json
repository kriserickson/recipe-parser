    "Thaw rolls according to directions on the package. After the rolls are thawed (but not risen), stretch out each roll and lay it flat on a greased cookie sheet. Wrap each slice of ham around a slice of cheese and place on top of each roll. Place 2 to 3 pieces of pineapple chunks on top of each rolled up slice of ham. Fold the dough over the toppings and pinch the edges together. Try to not have any holes in your dough, as your cheese will melt out of it. Bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool a few minutes before serving."
