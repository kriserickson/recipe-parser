    "Heat the oven to 180°C (gas mark 4). Lightly grease an 18cm\n(7in) round cake tin with a little extra butter or margarine and\ncut a piece of greaseproof paper or non-stick baking parchment to\nfit the base of the tin.",
    "Put all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and beat with\na wooden spoon or a hand-held mixer for 1 minute, or until just\ncombined. It's important not to beat the batter too much - just\nlong enough to make it smooth.",
    "Pour or spoon the mixture into the tin, smooth the top and bake\non the middle shelf of the oven for about 45-50 minutes. The cake\nis cooked when it looks well risen and golden; the top should\nspring back when lightly touched with a fingertip. Another test is\nto insert a skewer into the centre of the cake - it should come out\nclean.",
    "Let the cake sit in the tin for 5 minutes, then gently run a\nknife around the edge and turn the cake out onto a wire rack to\ncool.",
    "For the icing, place the dark chocolate and chopped butter in a\nheatproof bowl and set over a saucepan of very hot water until\nmelted. Cool for 15 minutes, then spread over the top of the cooled\ncake."
