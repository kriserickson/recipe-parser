    "Rinse the mussels and remove beards if necessary, discard any that do nut fully close when rinsing (these are dead).",
    "Bring the pasta to a boil and cook until al dente.",
    "While pasta is boiling, add all ingredients except for the cream and parmesan cheese to a covered sauce pan. Simmer mussels in white wine sauce on medium-high heat until they are fully cooked and open up, about 5 minutes. Stir sauce and mussels well.",
    "When the pasta is done, strain and stir into the mussels and white wine sauce. Now add cream and parmesan cheese. Simmer for 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally so the pasta can soak up the sauce.",
    "Serve immediately topped with a pinch fresh basil, parmesan cheese and 6-7 mussels."
