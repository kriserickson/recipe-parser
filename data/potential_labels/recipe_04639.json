    "Remove chocolate ice cream from freezer; let stand 15 minutes until slightly softened.",
    "Meanwhile lightly coat an 8 x 3-in. springform pan with nonstick spray. Pull apart half the macaroons to make coarse crumbs. Press lightly over bottom and 1⁄2 in. up sides of pan. Spread chocolate ice cream evenly over crust.",
    "Break remaining macaroons into coarse crumbs. Sprinkle evenly over chocolate ice cream. Freeze 45 minutes or until almost firm.",
    "Soften vanilla Swiss almond ice cream as above. Spread evenly over top of cake and freeze at least 4 hours or until firm.",
    "Pour chocolate topping on middle of cake; tilt pan to cover top completely. Let topping harden 5 minutes.",
    "Wrap pan with a warm, damp kitchen towel 1 minute to loosen sides. Remove pan sides; pat almonds onto sides of cake. (If ice cream is too hard for almonds to stick, leave cake at room temperature 5 to 10 minutes.)"
