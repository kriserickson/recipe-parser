    "Preheat oven to 400F. Stab a knife into the spaghetti squash randomly about half a dozen times to allow steam to release. Place on a baking sheet and cooking for 30-40 minutes, or until a knife can pierce through the skin easily. Slice in half and allow to cool. Remove seeds. Using a fork, run it inside the squash to create the spaghetti \"noodles.\"",
