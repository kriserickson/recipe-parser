    "Preheat oven to 400Â°F.",

Carefully wrap the biscuit dough around the cheese, pinch the biscuit to close and seal tight. Place the seam part down and arrange the biscuits so they are at least 1-inch apart. Bake for 10 minutes or until the surfface turn golden brown.",
    "While the biscuits are baked in the oven, mix the butter, garlic powder, salt, and parsley leaves together. Set aside.",
