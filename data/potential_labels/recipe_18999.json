    "Peel the squash (deseed if needed) and scrub the carrot, then chop into 1cm chunks, and place in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with two tablespoons of olive oil. Prick and throw in the whole chillies (this will give you a warming, gentle heat), then cook for 10 minutes, or until lightly golden, stirring regularly.",
    "Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, then add to the pan and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until softened and caramelised.",
    "Wrap the pasta in a clean tea towel and bash with a rolling pin to crack and break it up (give it some welly!), then stir into the pan with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Tip in the beans (juices and all) and scrunch in the tomatoes, along with three tinsâ€™ worth of water. Pop the lid on and simmer for 20 minutes, or until thickened and the pasta is cooked, stirring occasionally.",
    "Meanwhile, strip the rosemary leaves into a mortar, add a pinch of salt and bash to a paste with the pestle, then muddle in three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and the vinegar. Swirl into the pan and serve up."
