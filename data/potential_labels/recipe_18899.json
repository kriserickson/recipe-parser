Place dough in lightly floured bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow to prove in warm place until doubled in size. Press out dough lightly on a floured board until dough is a roughly 25cm x 25cm square. Fold the dough into shape by taking top corners of dough and folding it over remaining dough to about the 2/3 mark. Then take top left corner and fold about 2/3 of the way over dough. Then take top right corner and fold over the top of the dough. Dough should now resemble a wedge shape. Roll up the dough from thickest to thinnest. Place in greased loaf tin with the seam facing down. Use a knife to cut a slit about 1/2 cm deep down the length of the dough. Allow dough to prove for another 30 mins. Bake in oven for 20-25 mins."
