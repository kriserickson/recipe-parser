    "Wash the carrots well, especially if they are not organic. With a vegetable peeler, peel the carrots into long thing strips and sprinkle with salt.",
    "Coat the bottom of a large pan with the olive oil and heat on medium-high heat. When hot, add the carrots. Toss frequently (this works well with tongs). When the carrots start to soften, add the garlic and pepper (add onion here too if you like).",
    "Keep tossing for a couple of minutes until some of the carrots get brown around the edges (don't burn!) and the garlic is golden. Serve with your favorite pasta sauce (tomato based, I really can't vouch for alfredo or other fancy sauces).",
    "The nice thing is that it can be twirled with a fork the same way as regular pasta! Great if you're a carrot lover as I am."
