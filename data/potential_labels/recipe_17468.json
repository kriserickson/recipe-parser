    "Trim most of the of fat from the exterior of the meat but not all of it. Leave no more than 1/8\". Some folks like to leave it all on hoping it will melt and baste the meat, but it cannot penetrate the meat! I want the seasonings on the meat, not on the fat, and I want the meat to get a crunchy flavorful, seasoned bark, not soft fat. Most of the butts I cook are 4 to 6 pounds, pretty well trimmed, and tied with butcher's twine to keep them from falling apart. If yours is not already tied, hogtie it with kite string. Don't worry if it isn't fancy, you're going to throw it out, just rope it so it doesn't fall apart.",
    "Dry brine. If you have the time salt it 12 to 24 hours in advance. Called dry brining, this gives the salt a chance to start penetrating. If you dry brine you must usa a rub with no salt in it like Meathead's Memphis Dust. The spices will not penetrate, but the salt will. Just before cooking, wet the surface with water and sprinkle on the Meathead's Memphis Dust. The water helps the rub dissolve and adhere. Water dissolves the rub better than oil. Some folks like to slather it with yellow mustard. I don't think it makes much difference which you use, water or mustard. In fact, bottled mustard is mostly water. If you want mustard flavor, use mustard powder. I've done them side by side and there are so many other flavors going on the mustard gets lost. Marinating will not penetrate a big hunk very far, so don't bother. Read my article on marinating.",
    "Fire up. Insert a digital probe like the Maverick ET-733 and position the tip right in the center. Make sure it is not within 1/2\" of the bone. Start in the morning and fire up a smoker to about 225°F or set up a grill for 2-zone or indirect smoke cooking (cooker setups are described in the technique section of this site). Put the meat on, right on the grate, not in a pan, add about 4 ounces of wood chips, pellets, or chunks to the fir, and go drink a coffee. Go make your sauce, slaw, and beans. Go watch the game. Then cut the lawn. Wash the windows. Smoke a cigar. Unfold the lawn chair and read a book. You've got plenty of time. Just check your cooker every hour or so to make sure the fuel is sufficient and you are holding at 225 to 250°F. If it goes up to 300°F, don't worry. Butt is forgiving. But try to keep it down under 250°F. Add additional doses of wood, about 4 ounces at a time, every 30 minutes for the first two hours. The exact amount will be determined by your preferences and your cooker.",
    "The stall. If you are cooking at 225°F to 250°F when the meat hits about 150°F internal temp it will probably stall. The internal temp won't go up for hours. That's because the moisture evaporating from the surface is cooling the meat at the same rate as the hot air is warming it and it stalls. You can just ride it out or you can bust through by cranking the heat to about 300°F or by wrapping the meat tightly in foil. This is called the Texas Crutch. To learn more about the stall click here. But the beauty of the stall is that it forms the bark, the dry, jerky like crust.",
    "Finishing. When it hits about 170°F, collagens, which are part of the connective tissues, begin to melt and turn to gelatin. That's magic baby. The meat gets much more tender when this happens. And juicy. When it hits 195°F, it may be ready, and it may not be ready. Usually I shoot for 203°F, but it's time to check. The exterior should be dark brown. Some rubs and cookers will make the meat look black like a meteorite, but it is not burnt and it doesn't taste burnt. There may be glistening bits of melted fat. On a gas cooker it may look shiny pink. If there is a bone, use a glove or paper towel to protect your fingers and wiggle the bone. If it turns easily and comes out of the meat, the collagens have melted and you are done. If there is no bone, use the \"stick a fork in it method\". Insert a fork and try to rotate it 90 degrees. If it turns with only a little torque, you're done. If it's not done, close the lid and go drink a mint julep for 30 minutes. If the internal temp hits 195°F but the meat is still not tender, push on up to 203°F. At this number the meat seems to soften significantly. If it is still not soft, you've just got a tough butt. Wrap tough butts in aluminum foil and let them go for another hour. If you can't control the temp on your cooker, wrap the meat in heavy duty foil and move it indoors into a 225°F oven. Do not add sauce while it is on the cooker. That comes after you pull it.",
    "Taste. When it is finally ready, go ahead, take a taste. You should notice a thick flavorful crust, and right below it is the telltale \"smoke ring\", the bright pink color caused by smoke mixing with combustion gases and moisture. If you are more than an hour from mealtime, you can leave the meat on the cooker with the heat off or put it in the indoor oven and hold it there by dialing the temp down to about 170°F. If you are more than 2 hours from mealtime, wrap it in foil to keep it from drying out and hold it at 170°F. If you are taking the meat to a party, use a faux cambro, which is nothing more than a tight plastic beer cooler in which you can hold the meat. Leave the probe in the meat, wrap the hunk tightly in foil, wrap the foil with more towels, and put it the whole thing in the cooler. Fill up the cooler with more towels, blankets, or newspaper to keep the meat insulated. Hang the thermometer cord over the lid of the cooler, and close it tightly. Plug the cord into the readout and make sure it never drops below 145°F. Just know that this technique will soften the bark and change the texture of the meat very slightly."
