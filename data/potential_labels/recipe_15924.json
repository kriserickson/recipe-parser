    "Preheat the oven to 375ÂºF. Peel or scrub the carrots, then slice them into rounds. Boil or steam the carrots until they are extremely soft (I steamed for 15 minutes, but this will depend on the size of your carrots).",
    "Place the cooked carrots in a large bowl and mash with a potato masher. Add the eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together until well combined.",
    "Add the milk to the bowl and whisk until combined again. Finally, add the rolled oats, walnuts, and raisins and stir with a large spoon until combined. Pour the oat mixture into a 3 quart casserole dish coated with non-stick spray.",
    "In a separate small bowl, combine the cream cheese, egg yolk, vanilla, lemon juice, and sugar. Whisk or stir with a fork until smooth. If needed, microwave for 15 seconds to slightly warm the cream cheese mixture so it is slightly more fluid, then drizzle it over the oat mixture in the casserole dish.",
    "Bake the Carrot Cake Oatmeal for 45 minutes, or until the cream cheese mixture is slightly golden brown on top. Serve immediately, or divide into single portions, then refrigerate."
