    "In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer such as Kitchen Aid, combine 2 cups sourdough starter with 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.",
    "Mix on low speed until well blended, about 2-3 minutes.",
    "Cover slightly with plastic wrap and let sit on the counter for 2 hours.",
    "When dough has sat for 2 hours, add to the bread machine pan the milk, 2 tablespoons of melted butter, egg, salt and sugar.",
    "Add the sourdough mixture (I just dumped it in from the bowl).",
    "Add the 1 3/4 cup flour and gently smooth out evenly with your hand.",
    "Turn on the dough cycle.",
    "For the first 5 minutes check dough and add additional water or flour, which ever is needed.",
    "When dough cycle is completed turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and form into a ball.",
    "Using a roller, flatten the dough to a large oval 1/2 inch thick.",
    "Cut dough into 4 inch rounds using a sharp cutter.",
    "Transfer rounds to a greased baking dish.",
    "Gather up excess dough and repeat until all dough is used.",
    "Brush tops with 1 tablespoon melted butter, cover and let rise.",
    "NOTE: The buns will rise some more once placed in the oven.",
    "For quick rise starters 1-1 1/2 hours.",
    "For slow rise starters 2 to 2 1/2 hours.",
    "Bake for 15-18 minutes in 350 F oven or until golden brown.",
    "Cool slightly then slice with bread knife before serving. (For best results I think, place on the grill cut side down for 15-20 seconds before applying your burger).",
    "NOTE: All starters are different so the amount of flour, water and rise time may be different. For this recipe I used Donna M's SF Starter.",
    "1",
    "Dissolve the yeast in warm water until bubbly, about 5 minutes.",
    "Stir in the 1 cup of starter and 2 cups flour.",
    "Allow the mixture to rise until double, about 1 hour.",
    "Stir in honey, milk, salt, oil and eggs; mixing well.",
    "Add the bran and enough flour to make soft dough.",
    "Knead gently until smooth and elastic, working in more flour as needed, form into a ball.",
    "Grease a large glass bowl, place dough in bowl and turn over to grease the top, cover and let rise until double, approximately 1 hour.",
    "Punch dough down, knead 2 minutes, divide dough in half and shape each into a 12-inch log.",
    "With a bread knife, slice each log into 7 equal portions and with lightly floured hands, shape into round balls.",
    "Place on greased cookie sheet and flatten slightly.",
    "Brush with egg white wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired; cover and refrigerate 2 hours.",
    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.",
    "Remove dough from refrigerator and allow to stand at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "Bake the buns in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "Slice with sharp bread knife before serving.",
    "Please note: When baking with sourdough it is difficult to give exact measurements as to flour. So much depends on the starter and how thick it is as not all starters are created the same."
