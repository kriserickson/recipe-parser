    "DIRECTIONS:",
    "Put all of your ingredients in a tall, narrow cup starting with the eggs first (important), then add the spices and finally end with the oil. The order of ingredients is important so make sure to start with the eggs and end with the oil. The reason this method works is because of the narrow cup so make sure to use a narrow cup and not a bowl. With an immersion blender (sometimes called a stick blender), start at the bottom of the cup and work your way up until it’s nice and smooth and creamy. You want to use the regular blending attachment NOT the whisk. The mayo is ready to use right away. It must be stored in the fridge and keeps for about 2 weeks. Enjoy!"
