When fat begins to render, add onion and cook until tender; about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic, cook for 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and franks. Stir until mixture thickens.",
    "Add beans, stock, bay leaves and salt to taste. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat then reduce to low-medium heat to simmer. Cover and cook until beans are tender, about 45 minutes. Discard bay leaves, serve and top with cilantro and jalapeño.",
