    "Start off by doing all the chopping: carrots, cilantro, garlic, ginger, spring onion and mushrooms (if needed).",
    "Put the water, coconut milk, vegetable stock and chopped carrots in a pot and boil for three to four minutes until the carrots start to soften slightly.",
    "During these few minutes, stir-fry the mushrooms on medium to high heat in a pan for a couple of minutes together with the water, the tamari, the chopped ginger and garlic. Then remove from the stove, and add the chopped spring onion and the cilantro.",
    "Transfer the soup (carrots/water/coconut milk) to a food processor, add the garlic and the ginger and run on full speed for half a minute or until completely smooth. Then pour into serving bowls, and add a very generous serving of the mushroom/spring-onion/cilantro mix. Squeeze over some lime and serve immediately."
