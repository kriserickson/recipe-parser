    "Produce Prep: Mince the garlic. Rinse and dice the green onion(s). Rinse the baby kale. Remove the skin from the avocado and cut the flesh into small squares. Rinse and chop the cilantro (if using).",
    "Crumble tempeh into a bowl. Sprinkle with soy sauce, and add the sriracha. Stir together, then stir in nutritional yeast.",
    "In a wok or pan, bring the olive oil up to medium heat. (To make this recipe oil-free, omit the olive oil and use a non-stick pan.) Add tempeh mixture and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan frequently with a spatula to prevent sticking, until tempeh is browned and crisp in places (5-7 minutes). With a few minutes left to cook the tempeh, stir in the garlic.",
    "Serve the tempeh mixture over warm corn tortillas, and top with baby kale, green onion, salsa and/or cilantro. Enjoy!"
