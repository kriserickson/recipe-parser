    "In a large saucepan, add eggs with enough water to cover completely. Bring to a boil, then cover for 12 minutes. In the meantime, prep a small ice bath. Once eggs are done, add to ice bath and let cool.",
    "Rinse your saucepan, then add it back to the stove with vinegar, beet, water, sugar, bay leaf, salt, garlic & mustard seeds. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 15 minutes. Let mixture cool completely (for quicker results, set over an ice bath to cool). While vinegar mixture, peel the hardboiled eggs and set aside.",
    "When vinegar mixture is cool to the touch, submerge hard-boiled eggs and let marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Once you're ready to serve, drain eggs from their liquid, pat dry and cut into halves.",
    "In the meantime, bring 2 cups of water and quinoa to a boil in a large saucepan. Once boiling, simmer and cover for 15 minutes or until fluffy. Set aside to cool.",
    "In a mixing bowl, tear kale into bite sized pieces. Toss kale with the juice of 1-2 lemons (to taste) and a sprinkle of sea salt. Massage the kale well to tenderize the greens. Set aside and let marinate - the longer you let it sit, the more tender the kale will be.",
    "Before serving, drizzle kale with olive oil and toss with flaky sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Mix in cooled quinoa, avocado, radish and hempseeds. Top with microgreens and halved beet-pickled egg. Serve immediately!"
