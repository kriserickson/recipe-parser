    "Combine first 7 ingredients (coconut milk through fish sauce) in a medium saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, 8 to 9 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in cilantro and green onions. Set aside to cool slightly. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Scoop out 1/4 cup of the sauce for marinating the fish. Save the remainder to serve later.",
    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and place fish fillets on top. Season fish with salt and pepper then brush fish with the 1/4 cup of reserved sauce. Cook fish in oven until opaque in center, 10-20 minutes, depending on thickness of fish. Serve fish with hot rice and remaining sauce. Sprinkle with additional cilantro and scallions, if desired."
