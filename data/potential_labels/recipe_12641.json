    "1 Preheat the oven to 220°C/fan 200°C/gas mark 7. Place the butternut squash in a roasting tin and drizzle over 1 tbsp oil. Roast in the oven for 35-40 minutes or until soft. Remove and leave to cool.",
    "2 Heat ½ tbsp oil in a small frying pan. Cook the red onion for 6-8 minutes, before adding the garlic and spices. Continue to cook for a further 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.",
    "3 Place the drained chickpeas in a food processor and pulse a few times until slightly broken up but still chunky. Place the roasted butternut squash in a bowl and mash with the back of a fork until you have a rough textured puree. Add the chickpeas, red onion and herbs, then season well and mix until everything is evenly combined. Shape into 12 balls, then place on to a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper and place in the fridge for 20 minutes until firmed up. Transfer the falafels to a baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes until golden.",
    "4 Meanwhile, put all the ingredients for the zhoug into a mini food processor and blitz to a sauce. Serve the warm falafels with a drizzle of zhoug on top."
