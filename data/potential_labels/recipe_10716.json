    "Pumpkin Cheesecake: In large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth; beat in sugar for about 2 minutes. Beat in pumpkin, cream and pumpkin pie spice. Scrape into two 6-oz (175 mL) ramekins or glasses, smoothing tops. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.",
    "Whipped Cream: In bowl, beat cream with sugar until soft peaks form. Spoon over cheesecakes. (Make-ahead: Cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.)",
    "Tip From the Test Kitchen: Don't have pumpkin pie spice on hand? Whisk together 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground ginger and 1/4 tsp each nutmeg and ground cloves, and use 1/4 tsp from that mixture."
