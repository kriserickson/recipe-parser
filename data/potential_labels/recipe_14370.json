    "In a large soup pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil on medium-high heat. Add chopped onion and cook for 1 minute. Then add chopped green bell pepper and cook for another minute on medium-high heat. Remove vegetables from the pan.",
    "Add another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, heat it up on medium-high heat. Slice chicken into small pieces. Season chicken slices generously with paprika, oregano, basil, and salt. Sautee on medium-high heat until browned on both sides. The chicken does not have to be cooked all the way through, as you will continue cooking it in the next steps.",
    "Return cooked onions and bell peppers to the pan. Add chopped carrots, tomatoes, red kidney beans, fresh spinach, and minced garlic. Add chicken broth and water. Add 1/2 teaspoon of oregano and 1/2 teaspoon basil. Bring to boil and then simmer for 15-20 minutes until carrots are cooked and chicken cooked through. Season with salt to taste."
