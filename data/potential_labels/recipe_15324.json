    "In a sprouted measuring cup, mix the yeast, sugar, and olive oil into 1 ¼ cups warm water (about 100 degrees, or just warm to the touch), and let sit until bubbly, about 3 minutes. Put 3 cups flour in a mixer fitted with the dough hook, and add the salt. Pour in the yeast mixture, and mix at medium speed until a rough, sticky ball of dough comes together, about 1 minute, adding a little more flour or water as necessary. Let rest 5 minutes in the mixer, then mix on low until the dough is no longer sticky, about 1 minute. Oil your hands, transfer the dough to the counter, and knead until very smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to an oiled bowl, and cover the surface of the bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Slowly leavened dough is tastier. Before making the pizza bring the dough to room temperature."
