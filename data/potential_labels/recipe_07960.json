    "How to Make It",
    "1. Preheat oven to 200ºF.",
    "2. Wash the kale and pat dry.",
    "3. Remove the stems by tearing kale off into large, palm-sized leaves and place in a large bowl. Discard the stems (or add them to smoothies for later).",
    "4. In a food processor or high­-powered blender make the cheese sauce by processing the remaining ingredients (not the kale) together until smooth. This may take a few minutes and you may need to scrape the sides of your food processor or blender during this step. Sauce will be slightly thick.",
    "5. Add the sauce to the bowl of kale leaves and massage kale and sauce together until leaves are evenly coated.",
    "6. Single layer the kale leaves on two large baking sheets.",
    "7. Bake for 1 hour. Flip and bake for another 30 to ­40 minutes or until dry and crispy.",
    "8. Cool and store in an airtight container."
