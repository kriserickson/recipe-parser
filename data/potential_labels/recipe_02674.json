    "Slice open the croissants and fill with a generous amount of rocket leaves. Set aside.",
    "In a small non-stick saucepan with a handle, whisk the eggs together until combined. Place the saucepan over a medium-low heat and, using a wooden spoon, slowly pull the eggs towards the centre. Keep the mixture moving until you have really creamy scrambled eggs. Make sure not to overcook the eggs — take them off the heat while they are still slightly runny and creamy.",
    "Season with sea salt and black pepper and stir through the butter and goat’s cheese. Serve in the open croissants with an extra sprinkle of black pepper and a few snips of chives."
