    "For the volcano chipotle sauce: In a saucepot over medium heat, combine the ketchup, chipotle puree, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, cayenne, granulated garlic, Sriracha, red pepper flakes, brown sugar, hot sauce, mustard, salt and liquid smoke for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Keep partially covered for some ventilation. For maximum heat, add more red pepper flakes. Turn the deep fryer to 375 degrees F.",
    "For the chicken wings: No seasoning needed. Drop the wings, in batches, in the deep fryer or home fryer for 8 minutes. A good way to know when the wings are done is when they float on the top of the oil for 30 seconds. If you don't have a fryer at home, preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. Place the wings on a greased sheet tray and cook for 25 minutes. Flip your chicken at the halfway mark. Remove the wings from the fryer or oven and place in a bowl. Cover with your volcano chipotle sauce and toss. Best served with blue cheese and celery.",
