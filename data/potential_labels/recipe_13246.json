    "In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In another bowl, beat egg yolks until foamy; add milk and vanilla. Stir into crumb mixture until dough is stiff enough to knead.",
    "Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 8-10 times. Divide dough into four pieces. Roll each portion into a 1/4-in.-thick rectangle; cut into 4-in. x 1-1/2-in. strips. Cut a 2-in. lengthwise slit down the middle of each strip; pull one of the ends through the slit like a bow.",
    "In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375°. Fry dough strips, a few at a time, until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Dust with confectioners’ sugar. Yield: 40 cookies."
