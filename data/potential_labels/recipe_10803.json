    "In a heavy skillet set over medium high heat melt a little bit of coconut oil. When oil is nice and hot, add onions, mushrooms, salt and pepper and cook until the veggies are fragrant and softened, about 2-3 minutes.",
    "Add ground beef, garam masala, curry, ginger and cinnamon and continue cooking until the beef is no longer pink in color.",
    "Throw in the chopped kale and cook, stirring delicately, until the kale starts to wilt and turns a vivid dark green.",

    "Transfer to a bowl (it’s very important that you use a bowl here, else you would totally lose the right to call this a breakfast bowl) and garnish with a handful of toasted coconut and a few tablespoons of thick and delicious coconut milk."
