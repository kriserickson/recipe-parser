    "Squeeze the lime juice into a shallow bowl, and add the fish. Turn the fish pieces over a couple of times to make sure they are covered in lime juice. Set aside.",
    "In a heavy, wide, high-sided skillet (you could use a nonstick wok), heat the coconut milk over medium heat until you can see some oil pooling on the top (2-3 minutes). Add the onion, garlic, pepper, pepper flakes, tomatoes, salt, pepper, thyme and vinegar. Cook, stirring once or twice to incorporate the ingredients, for 2 minutes, or until the liquid comes to a low boil. Reduce heat to low, and add the fish along with any lime juice in the bowl.",
    "Cover, and cook at a low simmer for 10 minutes. Taste, and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper or additional lime juice, if needed.",
    "Serve hot."
