    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.",
    "Slice the sweet potatoes into 1/8 inch thick straws or use a mandolin slicer and do the same. Place the straws on a baking sheet and toss them with the melted coconut oil, curry powder, salt and pepper. Toss well. Divide the straws between two baking sheets. Bake for 15 minutes, toss, and then bake another 15-20 minutes more or until just beginning to crisp on the edges.",
    "Meanwhile add the salmon to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until itâ€™s somewhat ground. You can also chop the salmon very finely with a sharp knife.",
    "Remove and add the chopped salmon to a bowl with the Panko bread crumbs, parmesan, thai red curry paste, fish sauce, ginger and garlic. Mix with a spoon until just combined. Form into 4 equally sized burgers. Heat a skillet (or grill) over medium-high heat with a tablespoon of coconut oil. Cook burgers on each side until golden, about 3-4 minutes per side.",
    "In a bowl mix together the yogurt, mint, crushed red pepper, lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix and place in the fridge until ready to serve.",
    "To assemble the wraps place a salmon patty on a leaf of lettuce. Add a dollop of the minted yogurt, a few slices of cucumber + mango. Top with the crispy sweet potato straws and a sprinkle of crumbled goat cheese."
