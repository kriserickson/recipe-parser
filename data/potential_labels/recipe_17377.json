    "Heat the olive oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and saute until tender, about 3 minutes (watch carefully to make sure it doesn’t brown or it will be bitter). Add the chorizo and paprika, and saute another minute. Add the toasted bread and stir to coat with the paprika oil. Add the stock (start with 4 cups and add more if needed; I ended up adding a little more stock since the bread soaks up a lot of liquid). Season with salt.",
    "Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer. Crack the eggs on top, cover and continue to cook until the eggs whites are set but the yolks are still runny.",
    "Garnish with parsley. Ladle the soup into bowls. Place an egg on top. Sprinkle with a little more paprika and parsley.",
    "*To toast the bread. Heat a skillet with 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the bread and cook about 5 minutes, until lightly golden and crispy, giving it a stir from time to time. Transfer to paper towels to drain."
