    "Heat oven to 350Â°. Brush 1 sheet phyllo lightly with butter and sprinkle a pinch of sugar around border; gather edges and place in muffin pan cup, lining bottom and sides. Repeat with remaining sheets. Bake until crisp, 7 to 8 minutes. Let rest in pan 2 to 3 minutes; transfer cups to a wire rack and cool. In a saucepan, boil thawed blueberries, cornstarch, remaining 1/3 cup sugar and nutmeg. Cook until syrupy, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Remove from heat; mash berries lightly and cool, 15 minutes. Stir in fresh berries. Assemble flowers: Fill each cup with 1/4 cup sorbet and top with berry mixture."
