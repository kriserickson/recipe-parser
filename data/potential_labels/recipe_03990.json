    "In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well. You want the vegetables to hold together in the dough so you may need to add more water or flour depending on how wet your veggie mix is.",
    "Over medium heat, drizzle a drop of oil into a non-stick pan.",
    "Scoop approximately two tablespoons of vegetable mixture onto the heated pan and flatten with the back of the spoon.",
    "Cook until the edges are brown and then flip to cook the other side.",
    "Once crispy, drain off the excess oil on a paper towel. If you skip this step, the fritter will become soft and mushy (I found out the hard way).",
    "Serve in a sandwich, a wrap, or on its own with different sauces and chutneys."
