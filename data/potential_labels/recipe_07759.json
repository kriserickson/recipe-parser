    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan with melted butter or cooking spray.",
    "Make the crust: Thoroughly mix together the nuts, graham crackers, vanilla wafers, and melted butter in a medium bowl. Pat mixture into prepared pan, pressing firmly into bottom and about 1 1/2 inches up the sides.",
    "Make the filling: Using a stand or hand mixer, beat the cream cheese on low until light and fluffy. Add the sugar a little at a time and beat until creamy. Add 1 egg at a time, beating until smooth after each egg. Add the flour, vanilla, and lemon juice, and mix well. Add the sour cream, and beat well. Firmly tap the bowl against the counter to release bubbles from the filling.",
    "Pour the cheesecake filling into the springform pan, shaking the pan to ensure that the filling is evenly distributed. Cook on the oven's middle rack for 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until firm. Turn off the oven's heat, and leave the cheesecake in the oven with its door propped open for 1 hour.",
    "Remove cheesecake from oven, and let cool completely on the countertop before transferring to the refrigerator to chill for at least 12 hours.",
    "Make the blueberry compote (optional): Combine the blueberries, lemon juice, sugar, and lemon zest in a small saucepan set over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the cornstarch, and cook until the blueberries have broken down and the sauce has thickened slightly.",
    "Serve plain or with whipped cream, fresh fruit, or warm blueberry compote.",
