    "Preheat the oven to 325F. Oil donut pans (mini bundt pans work well, too!) with coconut oil. Set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, combine rice flour, coconut flour, arrowroot, sugar, baking powder, psyllium, salt, and baking soda, stirring to incorporate everything evenly. Add apple sauce, coconut oil, hot water, and almond or vanilla extract. Stir to combine.",
    "Using a tablespoon, spoon about 2½ scoops into each mold, spreading the batter to fill the molds evenly. Bake 15 minutes, until the edges begin to go golden brown. Remove and let cool at least 10 minutes before icing (the cooler the donuts the thicker the icing will go on). Dip each donut in icing to serve. Yields about 12 donuts.",

    "Add almond milk, Better Than Soy Milk Powder, coconut flour, agave, and raspberry jam to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to combine. Turn the food processor on and, while the blade is running, add vanilla extract. Add half of the coconut oil. Then add the lemon or lime juice. Then add the second half of the coconut oil. Blend 10 seconds more. Your icing should have a glossy, creamy consistency. If your icing breaks, the best thing to do is leave your food processor running until you reach a smooth texture -- the heat of the blades melts the coconut oil and brings everything back together."
