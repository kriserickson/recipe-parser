    "Cook pasta in salted boiling water according to package until al dante. I like to add a little olive oil to the cooking water. Before you drain pasta, reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water for later.",
    "In a large pot, heat the extra virgin olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add chopped onions and cook for 2 minutes, stirring regularly, until translucent. Add garlic, oregano, Aleppo pepper, and crushed pepper flakes. Stir till fragrant.",
    "Now add thawed broccoli florets. Cook 4 minutes, tossing regularly.",
    "Add cannellini beans. And season with salt and pepper. Cook another 3 minutes or so, tossing regularly.",
    "Add the cooked pasta and about 1/3 cup of the reserved cooking water into the pot. Add fresh parsley, za’atar spice, and Parmesan cheese. Toss to combine. If you need to, add a little bit more of the pasta cooking water to help combine everything. Taste and adjust seasoning. Cook until everything is very well warmed through.",
    "Transfer to serving bowls. Sprinkle toasted pine nuts, more za’atar spice, and more crushed red pepper flakes on top. Enjoy!"
