    "Preheat the oil to 350 degrees F. Dust the dough with the flour. Pound out the dough as thin as possible with your hands or with a rolling pin. Cut the dough into 2 pieces. Carefully place the dough into the hot oil. Cook until the dough is browned, 1 to 2 minutes, then repeat on the other side. Carefully transfer the dough from the oil to a paper-towel-lined plate.",
    "Place the dough on a clean plate. Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the dough and dust with the powdered sugar.",
