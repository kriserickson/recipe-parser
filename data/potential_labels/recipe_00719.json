    "Roast the pumpkin. (you can do this step in advance). I find pumpkins difficult to cut into so I start by softening mine in the oven. Place whole pumpkin in the oven for 15-20 minutes. Remove it from the oven and when it’s cool enough to touch slice it in to quarters. Drizzle the quarters with olive oil, salt and pepper, and continue roasting in the oven for 35-50 minutes until the flesh is really soft. (time will depend on the size of your pumpkin(s). Remove from the oven. Let cool and scoop out the seeds and guts. Scrape the pumpkin flesh from the skin and set aside until you’re ready for it to go into the soup.",
    "In a large pot over medium heat, heat the coconut oil. Add the onion and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until soft and translucent and add garlic cloves lime leaves, curry paste and ginger. Cook until fragrant, about 2-3 more minutes.",
    "Add the pumpkin and mix everything together. Let the pumpkin cook few more minutes, breaking apart the larger pieces with your wooden spoon or spatula. Before things start sticking to the bottom of your pot, add the coconut milk and the veggie broth. Add the maple syrup and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Remove lime leaves and pour the soup into a high speed blender (you may have to work in batches), and puree until smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings."
