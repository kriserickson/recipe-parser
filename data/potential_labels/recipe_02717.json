    "In a large pot, add the cauliflower, carrots, and potatoes. Pour enough water in to cover the vegetables by an inch and bring it to a boil. Once the water boils, lower the heat and let the vegetables simmer until they are very soft, about 25 minutes.",
    "In a large pan, sauté the onion and garlic in butter and oil for roughly five minutes, then add chili powder and tumeric. Add the tomatoes and simmer until the oil separates, then add the cooked vegetables and mix in the pav bhaji masala and black salt. Mash the vegetables using a heat-proof spatula or potato masher. Let the vegetables cook for another five minutes, adding salt if needed.",
    "While the vegetables are cooking, prepare the pav by generously adding butter to the exposed side of the buns, then fry them buttered side down on a pan over medium flame. When golden brown, flip them over and fry for another two minutes, then set aside.",
    "Just before serving, add cilantro, a pat of butter (optional but recommended!), and lime juice to the dish. Serve with the warm pav and dig in."
