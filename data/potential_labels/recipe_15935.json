    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl whisk together the pumpkin, eggs, oil, milk, molasses, sugar, and pumpkin pie spice until very smooth.",
    "In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir very well. Pour the flour mixture into the bowl with the wet ingredients and stir just until evenly combined (try not to over stir or the end product will be gummy).",
    "Pour the batter into a loaf pan coated with non-stick spray and bake for one hour or until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Allow the bread to cool completely before slicing."
