    "In a large mixing bowl, combine white vinegar, olive oil, grated (or pressed) garlic, honey, thyme, parsley, basil and salt. Whisk until all combined. Add chicken thighs, mix with marinade well and let them marinade for about 20 minutes.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350 and preheat a seasoned cast iron pan (or an oven safe cooking pan) on stove-top over medium-high heat. Place chicken thighs in the skillet, skin down, and sear until they get a golden sear, about 3-4 minutes.",
    "While chicken is searing, mix potatoes in the same marinade.",
    "Flip the chicken and turn off the stove-top burner. Drain off most of the marinade and spread potatoes in the skillet and even as possible.",
    "Place skillet in the oven and bake for 35-45 minutes. (You may have to spread potatoes a little more about half way through baking, once chicken cooks down some.)"
