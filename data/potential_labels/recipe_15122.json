    "In a sauce pan, add the BBQ sauce, marmalade, and soy sauce. Turn the heat on low and let it simmer for 20 minutes, stirring a few times.",
    "Meanwhile, cut up your chicken breasts into cubes. In one bowl beat 2 eggs, while the other bowl should mix the dry ingredients.",
    "Dip pieces of chicken in the egg and then cover in flour/cornstarch. Set on an extra plate.",
    "Add a thin layer of oil to a frying pan and turn your stove on medium/high heat. Once it sizzles, add the chicken to the pan. Let it cook for 3-5 minutes each side until it's brown and cooked on the inside.",
    "Set the oily pieces on a paper towel and let drain.",
    "Add the chicken to the sauce and toss!",
    "Eat it on top of white rice and enjoy. I think veggies would be good with it such as green peppers or broccoli."
