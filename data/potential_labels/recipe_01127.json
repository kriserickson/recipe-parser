    "Lightly fry tortillas in a pan with a bit of oil – a few minutes on each side, until crispy. Place on paper towels when they’re done and salt them. Alternatively, brush with a little bit of oil and bake them in the oven (a few minutes on each side) until crispy. The time will completely depend on what kind of tortillas you’re using, so just watch them closely.",
