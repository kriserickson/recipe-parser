    "HOW TO MAKE IT",
    "In a medium skillet, sauté the shrimp for approximately 1-2 minutes per side and add salt to your shrimp while cooking. After the shrimp is cooked, place them in a bowl. Add the Cacique® Ranchero® Queso Fresco, the Cacique® Panela cheese, mango, onion, cilantro, and lime juice. Carefully mix everything very well. Let the mix stand for a couple of minutes. Serve a portion of the mix over each tortilla chip."
