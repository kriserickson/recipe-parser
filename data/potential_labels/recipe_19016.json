    "In a large pot, melt 2 sticks butter in water. When melted, add dry cornbread stuffing stirring to incorporate liquid, set aside. In a large saute pan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter and add sausage. With a wooden spoon break up pork and saute until lightly browned and cooked through. Remove sausage to paper towels to drain. In the same saute pan, melt remaining butter and saute onions with the garlic and celery until onions are translucent and celery is crisp tender. Add walnuts and saute for 1 minute. Add apples and saute for one minute more. Remove from heat. Combine cornbread stuffing with sauteed ingredients."
