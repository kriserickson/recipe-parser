    "Prepare the egg replacer mixture and line your baking sheets",
    "Preheat your oven to 350F (177C). In a small bowl whisk together the flax meal, non-dairy milk and apple cider vinegar. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes so the mixture thickens and curdles. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.",
    "2) Whisk together the dry ingredients",
    "In a medium mixing bowl whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt until well incorporated. Set aside.",
    "3) Whisk together the flavor building ingredients",
    "In another medium mixing bowl whisk together the sugar, peanut butter and coconut oil until well mixed. Mix in the flax meal mixture from step 1 followed by the molasses and vanilla extract.",
    "4) Build the cookie dough",
    "Add the flour mixture from Step 2 and mix until just incorporated. You may have to use your hands at this point because the dough will be pretty thick. Use your hands to fold in the chocolate chips.",
    "5) Bake the vegan cookies to perfection",
    "Form the dough into 1 ½ inch balls and place them on the cookie sheet so they're spaced about 2 to 3 inches apart. Use a fork to flatten them to ¾ inch and bake for 15 to 17 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through the baking duration. These cookies will not turn golden as they bake so it's important to pay attention to the baking time.",
    "Store the cookies in an air tight container at room temperature for about one week or in the freezer for up to two months. This recipe makes about 22 to 24 Vegan Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies."
