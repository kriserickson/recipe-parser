    "Combine salt, sugar, black, white and cayenne peppers, garlic and onion powders, cumin, paprika and gumbo file. To use, roll strips of pork in seasoning mix, coating meat completely and patting in well. Allow seasoned meat to stand in refrigerator three days, then smoke to internal temperature 165 degrees.",

    "I smoked a couple of pieces in my smoker with hickory chips for about 12 hours. Another couple of pieces I smoked in the oven of my electric range, using liquid smoke. They both came out great.",
    "For the liquid smoke technique I set my oven on warm (about 135 degrees), as Romeo does in his smokehouse, to dry the surface. Then I increased the temperature to 175 degrees and sprayed the meat with full-strength liquid hickory smoke from a plastic atomizer bottle. I gave it a fresh shot of liquid smoke every half-hour until it was cooked to the recommended 165 degrees (about 4 hours)."
