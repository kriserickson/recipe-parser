    "1 Rinse chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl, combine the flour, curry powder, salt and pepper. Toss the chicken pieces to coat.",
    "2 Heat oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven on medium high heat. Add chicken pieces in batches, being careful to not crowd the pan. Cook 2-4 minutes per side, or until the coating sets and browns a little. Remove the chicken from the pot as it cooks and set aside in a bowl.",
    "3 When the chicken has all been browned, add the ginger, garlic, chili pepper and 1/2 cup of the chicken broth to the saucepan. Cook for a minute or two, scraping the pan with a spatula and stirring to combine everything well. Whisk in the peanut butter, and the remaining 3 1/2 cups of broth slowly, stirring continuously to maintain an even texture.",
    "4 Return the chicken to the pot and simmer for 15-25 minutes.Â Right before serving, add the ground coriander, cilantro, mint and green onions. Add salt and lime juice to taste. Serve with rice."
