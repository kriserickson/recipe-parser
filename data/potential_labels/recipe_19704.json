    "Heat oven to 425 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets or roasting pans with parchment or foil. In a large bowl, toss the turnips and squash with the oil, sage and salt. Divide the mixture between the 2 baking sheets, then spread in an even layer.",
    "Transfer to the oven on the middle and lower shelves, and roast for 20 minutes, stirring the vegetables and rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Reduce the heat to 400 degrees and continue to roast until tender and caramelized, another 10 to 20 minutes, stirring and rotating again halfway through.",
    "Remove from the oven and brush with the agave. Return to the oven and cook until the vegetables appear glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve with sunflower seeds scattered on top."
