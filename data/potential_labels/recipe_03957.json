    "Bring 6 quarts of chicken broth to a boil and add about 2 tablespoons salt.",
    "In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat until the forma subsides. Add the onion and cook until soft and golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and cool. Stir in the cheeses, marjoram, parsley, and nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper.",
    "To form the agnolotti, drop heaping teaspoons of filling down one side of each pasta sheet at 3-inch intervals. Fold the pasta over the filling, pressing the dough flat between the lumps of filling. Using a pastry cutter, cut half-moons using the fold as the flat side of the moon.",
    "Drop the agnolotti into the boiling chicken broth and simmer rapidly until tender.",
    "Meanwhile, melt the remaining 6 tablespoons butter with the ramps in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan and cook 2 minutes until softened. Drain agnolotti and add to the pan. Sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano and toss over medium heat to coat.",
    "Serve immediately.",
