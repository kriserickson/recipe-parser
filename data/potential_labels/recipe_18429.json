    "To prepare brine, combine buttermilk, kosher salt and sugar in a bowl; stir to dissolve salt and sugar. Stir in lemon peel, rosemary, pepper and sage. Pour into a heavy zip-lock plastic bag. Add pork and squeeze bag to coat pork with brine. Seal bag and place on a plate. Refrigerate, turning bag occasionally, for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.",
    "Remove from refrigerator and let stand for 20 - 30 minutes.",
    "Remove pork from brine; discard brine. Grill pork over low heat on natural gas barbecue until done, about 30 - 35 minutes. Serves 4.",
    "Cook's Note: Do not substitute table salt for kosher salt in this recipe as the brine will be too salty."
