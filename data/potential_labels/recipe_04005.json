    "Preheat a grill or grill pan (I used an indoor grill pan).",
    "Divide the beef into 6 equal portions. Form each portion of meat into a patty that is 3/4 of an inch thick, making a deep depression in the center of the burger (this creates a flatter burger). Liberally season both sides of the patties with salt and pepper.",
    "Grill the burgers on both sides to your desired doneness. 1 minute before burgers are cooked through, top each burger with a slice of cheese and allow it to melt.",
    "Place cooked burgers on the buns and top with tomatoes, lettuce, red onions, and a spoonful of the horseradish mustard sauce. Place one small handful of potato chips on the top of the burger, top with the bun, and serve immediately.",
    "If you have extra sauce, I hear it’s delicious spooned straight into your mouth.",
    "This is one crunchy-licious burger.",
    "Also, this is a three-napkin meal. Just a warning.",
    "Make sure you check out the other Pass the Cookbook Club peeps to see what kind of tribute they’ve paid to Bobby!"
