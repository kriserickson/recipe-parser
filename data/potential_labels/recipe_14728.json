    "Mix together the carrots, raisins, brown sugar, oil, and eggs in a large bowl. Add the remaining ingredients except for the cream cheese frosting and mix well. Pour the batter into 2 greased and floured 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans. Bake in a preheated 350F (180C) oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and frost the top of one layer with the frosting. Place the second layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake. Makes one 8-inch cake to serve 8 to 12.",
