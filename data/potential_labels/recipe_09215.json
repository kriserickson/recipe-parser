    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
    "In a medium bowl, combine ground beef, garlic and parsley. Mix with spatula until just combined. Using your hands, form 4 equally-sized patties. Season both sides with salt and pepper to taste",
    "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the burgers and cook for 4 to 5 minutes (for medium). Flip the patties, then immediately pour marinara around them in the pan. Simmer for another minute, then top each with cheese and 2 slices of pepperoni. Cover pan and cook until the cheese melts and the burger is cooked to your liking, about 3 minutes more.",
    "Meanwhile, make garlic buns. Brush melted butter on each half of the rolls. Sprinkle both sides with garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and parmesan. Bake until golden, about 10 minutes.",
    "Spread a dollop of marinara on each bottom bun followed by cooked burgers and the top bun halves."
