    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add gnocchi and allow to cook for two minutes. Drain gnocchi then toss with olive oil and one tablespoon of the butter. Set aside. Meanwhile over medium heat, melt remaining butter in a frying pan then add the zucchini, squash, corn and garlic. Add a couple shakes of salt and cook until veggies are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the parmesan cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste. Combine veggies and gnocchi and let sit for about 15 minutes. Garnish with additional shavings of parmesan cheese and basil. Serve warm or at room temperature."
