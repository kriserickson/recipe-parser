    "Place shredded left over salmon in a medium sized bowl. Add in carrots, garlic, parsley, cilantro panko bread/cornstarch and mix together. Add in beaten egg and continue mixing until completely incorporated. Add salt and pepper depending on your liking. Form salmon into a ball.",
    "Heat oil in a medium size frying pan and brown all sides of Salmon Meatballs. ( Stop here if you are just frying ) Cover cookie sheet with tin foil and grease with non stick oil. Arrange salmon meatballs into a baking sheet and bake for 15-30 minutes or until salmon is set. Serve salmon meatballs with ketchup or any sauce that you like. My clan like non-fat dressing. Enjoy!"
