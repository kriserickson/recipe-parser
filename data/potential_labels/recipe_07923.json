    "Position an oven rack about 4 to 6 inches from the heating element, and preheat the broiler. Use your finger to carefully open up the cavity of each pitted prune. Then, with a pastry bag (or a sealable plastic food storage bag), pipe the \"cheese\" into the prunes.",
    "Wrap each prune in a thin layer of prosciutto, and arrange them in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Broil for 2 to 4 minutes or until the prunes puff up and the prosciutto crisps and turns golden brown around the edges. Keep an eye on the prunes; they may be devils, but you don't want them to burn. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and season with pepper to taste before serving.",
    "Bag It!",
    "Don't have a pastry bag? Simply snip a ½-inch hole in the corner of a quartsized plastic food storage or freezer bag, and you're good to go."
