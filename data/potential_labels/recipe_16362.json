    "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or spray with cooking spray and set aside.",
    "Add the beaten eggs to a pie plate (or bowl) and mix the panko and flour in another.",
    "Dredge each chicken piece in the egg, then in the panko mixture, and add to the prepared baking tray. Repeat with remaining chicken. (***See notes)",
    "Bake for 10 minutes and turn the pieces, then continue to cook for another 10 minutes, or until chicken is done to your liking.",
    "In a large serving bowl add the cooked chicken and top with about 3/4 c of your favorite BWW sauce. Mix well. (If you are using multiple sauces divide chicken into separate bowls and use about 1/4 c sauce for every 20 wings).",
    "If you want to make these using a dry seasoning, add it to the panko/flour mixture for better results. If you don't have a Buffalo Wild Wings nearby, you can order sauces online or just use your favorite sauce from the grocery store!"
