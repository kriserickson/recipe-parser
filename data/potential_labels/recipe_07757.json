    "To make the sauce: Mix together the tomato sauce, orange juice, chicken stock, brown sugar, sriracha, soy sauce, chili garlic paste, and black pepper in a saucepan set over medium heat. Cook for a couple of minutes, or until the sauce has come together, and then keep warm.",
    "To make the chicken: Add the chicken, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, creole seasoning, and chili powder to a large mixing bowl and toss to combine. Add flour and cornstarch and keep tossing the chicken until each piece is completely coated.",
    "Add 3 tablespoons of olive oil to a wok set over medium heat. Once hot, add chicken and cook for 3 minutes on each side. You want to cook the chicken almost all the way through. Remove the chicken from the pan.",
    "Wipe the pan out with a paper towel and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, orange peel, and garlic. Cook for 1 minute to slightly cook the garlic and warm the orange peel. Add the sauce and chicken and bring the mixture to a boil. Cook for 1 minute, and then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve over warm rice and garnish with sesame seeds."
