    "1 Make the vinaigrette: Put the mustard, salt, sugar, vinegar and parsley in a blender and process until combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the blender, cover and process at its slowest setting.",
    "Drizzle in the olive oil slowly. When it is all in, move the blender to its highest setting and puree for about 90 seconds.",
    "2 ShredÂ the root vegetables: Peel all the vegetables except for the radishes, if you are using black ones. The slivers of black in the salad look cool, so I leave them in.",
    "Using a vegetable peeler or a coarse grater, slice shreds off the vegetables into a bowl. Try to keep the shreds roughly the same length if you can.",
    "3 Toss shredded vegetables with vinaigrette: To finish, toss some of the vinaigrette with the shredded vegetables and let stand in the fridge for at least 20 minutes before serving."
