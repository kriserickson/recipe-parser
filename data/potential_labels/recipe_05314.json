    "*TO COOK THE LENTILS: * Cook water, green lentils, onion, thyme and black pepper over medium-low heat with the lid on, for approx 10 min, until the lentils are soft. Drain well and discard the onion, then set aside to cool.",
    "TO MIX THE MEATBALL/POPCORNS: Add shrimps, ground pork, anchovies, grated ginger, curry powder, ground coriander, ground black pepper and salt in a food-processor, then pulse until the shrimps are coarsely minced and that the ingredients are evenly mixed. Transfer to a bowl, then add the minced pancetta (Not \"ground\", but minced like beef tartare. We don't want to do this in the food-processor because we want to retain some texture of the pancetta.) and chopped cilantro, then mix evenly.",
    "Evenly mix everything under \"spiced salt\". Set aside",
    "TO FRY: Add enough canola oil in a frying pot until it reaches 1 inch deep, then bring to 350F (or until it bubbles up quickly around an inserted wooden chopstick).",
    "Meanwhile, mix tapioca starch (or potato starch) with ground black pepper on a plate. Dab your finger with a bit of vegetable oil to prevent sticking (not water because it will trap too thick of a breading), then make little \"popcorns\" about 2 tsp each, and roll them in the starch to lightly coat. Don't worry about making a smooth surface. They can be a bit ragged. Once you have enough of 1 batch, start frying them without crowding the pot, until golden browned and crispy on all sides. Let drain on a paper-towel while you fry the next batch.",
    "When the popcorns are still hot, toss them with minced garlic and chili flakes, then season generously with spiced salt. Serve immediately."
