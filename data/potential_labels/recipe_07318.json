    "Combine wine, chives, garlic and onion in bowl. Add kangaroo meat, toss until coated. cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Remove meat from marinade, drain. Reserve marinade.",
    "Heat oil in pan; add meat. Cook over high heat 2 minutes to seal sides, turning. For rare meat, cook 2 more minutes. For medium meat, reduce heat to medium, continue cooking for 3 minutes. (If using steaks cook for 3-4 minutes, turning occasionally.) **Note: Kangaroo meat has a very low fat content and will become dry if overcooked. Cook it to rare or medium stage only and leave for a few minutes before serving. This will produce tender, juicy kangaroo meat.**",
    "Remove meat from pan. Cover and keep warm. Add reserved marinade and cream to pan juices, bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered 3 minutes or until sauce has reduced and thickened. Return meat to heated sauce in pan if further cooking/warming required - do not re-fry or heat in microwave!!",
    "Slice cooked fillets thinly and serve with warm sauce. Suggestion: Serve with mashed (or crushed sweet) potato and fresh vegetables"
