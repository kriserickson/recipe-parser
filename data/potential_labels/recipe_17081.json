    "Grease a deep dish pie pan and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350°F.",
    "Cobbler: In a large bowl, combine the sorghum flour, rice flour, potato starch, xanthan gum, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk well until combined. Stir in the milk, melted vegan butter, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth.",
    "Pour mixture into the prepared pie pan. Scoop the berries fairly on top of the batter, and sprinkle with a spoonful of sugar.",
    "Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until golden and cooked all the way through, and you don’t see any wet batter in the center. Remove from oven to a rack.",
    "Glaze: Once the cobbler is out of the oven, make the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth. You don’t want any lumps of powdered sugar. Drizzle the glaze over the top of the warm cobbler. You probably won’t need all of the glaze. Let cool and serve.",
    "The cobbler can be made one day ahead.",
    "NOTES",
    "This recipe works really well with the Julie’s Original all-purpose flour blend (1 cup in place of the sorghum flour, rice flour, potato starch and xanthan gum). If you are not gluten-free, you can use 1 cup all-purpose flour in place of the gluten-free flours and xanthan gum."
