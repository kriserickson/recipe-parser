    "First toast the walnuts slightly in an oven heated to 170 degrees. Let them cool down before adding them to your food processor along with dates, desiccated coconut and cranberries.",
    "Process until the mixture is well combined and has a crumbly texture.",
    "Now add gradually the water, a tablespoon at a time and keep processing until the mixture is sticky and holds together.",
    "Next get a square baking dish, line it up with cling film and press the mixture in. Press down firmly to ensure the mixture sticks well together.",
    "Pop in the fridge for a couple of hours, then cut in to bars and sprinkle with some more desiccated coconut",
    "If you want to make it nut free just replace the walnuts with either pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds. Same goes for cranberries which can be swapped for raisins."
