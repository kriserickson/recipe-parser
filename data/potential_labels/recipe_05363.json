    "Preheat oven 350 degrees. Halve small tomatoes. Quarter large tomatoes. Arrange the tomatoes on a baking sheet in a single layer. Scatter sliced onions over the pan. Nestle the thyme springs among the tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, depending on how cooked you would like your tomatoes.",
    "Remove pan from oven. Discard thyme sprigs. Allow tomatoes to cool slightly. Using a blender, food processor or food mill, blend the tomatoes until they liquified (as chunky or as smooth as you would prefer).",
    "If using sauce immediately, enjoy! If freezing, allow the sauce to cool, transfer to freezer bags and freeze."
