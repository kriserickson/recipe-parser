    "Heat the oil over a medium heat. Add the mushrooms and toss making sure they are coated in the oil. Grate in the garlic and continue to cook.",
    "Cook the pasta to the packet instructions.",
    "Drain and rinse the cashews. Add to a food processor with half of the water and blend. Add in the rest of the water, bit at a time. This makes a really thick sauce so if you prefer a more watery consistency then just add more water.",
    "When the mushrooms have cooked turn up the heat and add the wine. Bring to the boil and then reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the liquid has reduced by half.",
    "Add the thyme and the cashew cream, stir well and add the nutritional yeast.",
    "Season well and add the pasta.",
    "Serve up and top with some vegan parmesan."
