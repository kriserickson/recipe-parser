    "To prepare the mashed sweet potatoes: wash sweet potatoes, pierce twice with a fork, wrap in foil and bake at 400 degrees for about one hour until cooked.",
    "Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Peel cooled sweet potatoes and mash.",
    "Use a stand mixer or a hand mixer to combine all the casserole ingredients. Mix until well blended and smooth.",
    "Pour into an 8x8 baking dish and use a spoon or spatula to spread the mixture evenly.",
    "Combine topping ingredients in a small bowl. Mix thoroughly and sprinkle evenly on top of the casserole.",
    "Bake for about 30 minutes or until the topping is browned and crispy and the casserole is bubbly.",
    "NOTES",
    "To serve a crowd or a larger family (like mine!), double the recipe and bake the casserole in a 9x13 baking dish.",
    "I've only tried making this recipe with grassfed butter, but ghee should work just as well.",
    "I think this casserole has just the right amount of sweetness, but if you prefer less, you can skip the coconut nectar in the potatoes."
