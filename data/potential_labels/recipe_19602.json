    "Combine the beans, garlic, wine, oil, vinegar, thyme and red-pepper flakes in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker. Season lightly with salt and generously with pepper. Season the chicken thighs all over with salt and pepper, then nestle them in an even layer on top of the beans, skin-side up. Cover and cook on high for 3 hours or low for 6 hours.",
    "Line a sheet pan with foil and heat a broiler. Using tongs, remove the chicken thighs from the slow cooker, place them on the foil, skin-side up, and broil for 2 to 4 minutes, rotating once, until the chicken skin is golden and caramelized in spots.",
    "Stir the lemon juice, scallions and parsley into the beans. Serve the beans in bowls, and top with the chicken."
