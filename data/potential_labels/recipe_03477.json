    "Melt 1 tablespoon butter in the bottom of a medium-sized kettle over medium-high heat. Stir in quinoa and garlic, stirring and cooking for 2 minutes to lightly toast the grains and make the garlic fragrant. Add the salt, pepper and water. Bring to a light simmer, cover and cook for 13 to 15 minutes until quinoa is tender and the little “ringlets” have starting to come off each grain. (Remember to watch while the pot is cooking so the liquid does not overflow.) Liquid should be completely or mostly absorbed.",
    "Remove from heat and stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter, cornstarch and cheddar cheese. Cover and let sit for five minutes, then stir again and adjust salt and pepper as needed. Serve hot."
