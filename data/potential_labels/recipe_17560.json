    "Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF. Line a muffin tin with paper liners (or grease with coconut oil) and set aside.",
    "Beat together wet ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Add dry (minus the blueberries) and stir together until incorporated. Fold in the blueberries.",
    "Divide batter evenly between the muffin cups (this recipe makes about 9 - 10 muffins). Bake on the center rack for 20 - 23 minutes until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean.",
    "Allow muffins to cool in the pan for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack and cool completely.",
    "Once cooled, make the glaze. Melt the coconut butter over a double boiler until it's smooth and runny. Whisk in blueberry powder and drizzle over muffins. Sprinkle each with a touch more blueberry powder if desired and enjoy!"
