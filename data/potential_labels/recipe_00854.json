    "Whisk vinaigrette ingredients together then pour over salad base and mix well. Refrigerate for a few hours before serving. Viola! Yummy vegan veggie deliciousness. And extra points because my husband loves this salad. If a man likes it it passes the food test and isn't just \"healthy chick food\"."
