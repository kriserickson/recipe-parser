    "Add the olive oil to a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken and cook for 3 minutes per side, until golden and brown. Remove to a plate.",
    "Turn heat to medium and add zucchini and garlic and saut√© for 3 minutes, until zucchini is just softened and the garlic is fragrant. Add tomatoes and stir while cooking until they just begin to break down, about 1 minute. Stir in wine and use the back of a wooden spoon to stir up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Bring the wine to a simmer and toss in the chickpeas, artichoke hearts and olives, and stir to combine. Add the chicken back to the pan and nestle into the veggies. Simmer on medium-low for 8 minutes, then remove the chicken, turn heat to high and continue to cook until the pan is almost dry, about 2 minutes more. Sprinkle with fresh basil before serving."
