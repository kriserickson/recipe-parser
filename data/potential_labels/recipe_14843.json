    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in the butter using a pastry blender, 2 knives, or your fingers until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in buttermilk until the mixture forms a rough dough. Gently knead the dough 6 or 7 times on a lightly floured surface and roll to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out 2-inch rounds. Gather scraps and repeat until all the dough is used. Bake 1 inch apart on parchment paper-lined baking sheets until lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes. Serve warm.",
