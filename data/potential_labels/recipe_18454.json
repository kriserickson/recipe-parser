    "Heat up a non-stick pan to medium-high heat. After trial and error, I have found that these come out best with out using oil, so do not grease your pan (but make sure you’re using a good non-stick pan). Mix together all of the ingredients listed until you have a batter. In the pan, spoon in your batter and spread it around to make it thinner, you can make them whatever shape you’d like: large, small, round of more oblong like I have done. Here is a photo of the batter on the pan before it has properly cooked:"
