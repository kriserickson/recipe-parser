    "first chop 1 medium sized cauliflower in medium florets. rinse the cauliflower florets very well in water. boil water to which some salt has been added and take it a bowl or pan.",
    "add the cauliflower florets. cover the bowl and blanch them in the hot water. i usually get cauliflower, which takes lot of time to cook. so i blanch the florets for 15 to 20 minutes. but you can blanch for a few minutes to 5 minutes.",
    "meanwhile slice the potatoes in wedges. after 15 to 20 minutes, drain the cauliflower and keep aside.",
    "the step of blanching is optional and is only done if there are insects in the cauliflower."
