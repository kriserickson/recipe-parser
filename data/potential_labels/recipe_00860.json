    "Drop dough 2 Tbsp at a time (32g each. You can roll them into balls for more even rounds - the dough is sticky but I rolled half of mine just to compare) onto Silpat or parchment paper lined baking sheets, spacing cookies at least 2-inches apart. Bake in preheated oven 12 - 13 minutes until centers no longer look doughy. Allow to cool on baking sheet several minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Cool completely then sandwich 2 cookies together with the cream cheese filling. Store in an airtight container in a single layer.",
