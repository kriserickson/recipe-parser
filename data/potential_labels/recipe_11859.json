    "Note: To cook potatoes, carrots and onions with the corned meat. Scrub the vegetables, leave whole, do not peel the onion. Add to the corned meat in the last 10 minutes of the boiling time on the stove. For example, maintain the corned silverside on a gentle boil for ten minutes, add the vegetables, bring back to the boil and then time for a second ten minutes, gently boiling. If preparing in the 3 litre* DreamPot model, reduce the size of the corned silverside to no larger than a 1 kg piece."
