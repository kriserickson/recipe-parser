    "Preheat the oven to 200C/390F.",
    "Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into evenly sized matchsticks, about 0.5cm thick.",
    "Blanch the sweet potatoes in a bowl of boiling water for 10 minutes. This will remove the starch and soften the sweet potatoes slightly.",
    "Drain the sweet potatoes well and pat them dry with a clean tea towel or paper towels.",
    "Transfer the sweet potatoes into a zip lock freezer pack. Add the corn flour, salt, and black pepper to the back. Seal it and shake well, until the sweet potatoes are coated in the dry ingredients. Add the olive oil and shake again.",
    "Spread the sweet potato sticks out on a baking sheet lined with non-stick greaseproof baking paper. Do not crowd the sheets and this will stop the fries from becoming crispy. Use 2 baking trays if necessary. Grate the cheese over the fries.",
    "Bake the fries for 15 minutes, turn each fry, and bake for a further 15 minutes. Continue until the fries are at your desired crispy-ness level.",
    "When the fries are done, turn the heat down and allow them to rest in the cooling over with the door slightly ajar for 5 minutes.",
    "Serve with the dipping sauce of your choice!"
