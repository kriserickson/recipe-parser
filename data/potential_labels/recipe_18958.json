    "To Roast the Brussel Sprouts. Place the halved brussel sprouts on a pan, drizzle with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper and roast at 425 degrees until tender, about 30 minutes.",
    "To Roast the Squash. There are a few different ways you can cook squash but for this recipe I de-seeded it and roasted it in large chunks on a pan until tender. Once it was cooked, I peeled off the skin and diced it for the salad. I used 2 cups of kabocha squash and 2 cups of acorn squash, cooked at the same time as the brussel sprouts.",
    "To Cook the Beets. I peeled and chopped the beets and steamed them until tender. You can also boil them or roast them in the oven at the same time as the brussels and squash.",
    "To Make the Dressing. Add all the dressing ingredients to a blender and mix until smooth and creamy.",
    "To Assemble the Salad. Place everything in a large bowl, top with the dressing and mix well. Serve immediately or store in the fridge for up to 4 days."
