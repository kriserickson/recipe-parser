    "1/2 cup good barbecue sauce (like Sweet Baby Ray's)",

    "In a small bowl, combine the rub ingredients. Rub all sides of the ribs with rub mixture.",
    "Place the ribs in a large plastic zip bag and refrigerate overnight.",
    "In a small bowl, combine the barbecue sauce and apple butter; set aside.",
    "Cut the ribs into 2-rib portions to fit inside the slow cooker. Cover and cook on high 3 to 5 hours (or until ribs are 170 degrees).",
    "Remove the ribs from the slow cooker and drain off any liquid. Wipe the slow cooker dry. Place the ribs back into the slow cooker. Pour about 1/2 cup of the sauce over the ribs. Cover and cook on high about 30 minutes or until glazed. Serve with remaining sauce (warmed), as desired.",
