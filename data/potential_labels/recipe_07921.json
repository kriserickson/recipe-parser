    "Take out your 4 eggs and bring to room temperature. I crack mine in the blender and let them sit for 20 minutes or so.",
    "Add the apple cider vinegar, water and ¼ cup of melted coconut oil(not hot so you don't cook the eggs) blend on low for 30 seconds.",
    "Then add in the coconut flour, garlic power, salt and baking soda and blend for one minute.",
    "Grease your baking tin with the 1 tsp coconut oil. I used two small mini loaves for this recipe.",
    "Pour the batter in your pans and bake at 350 degrees for 40 - 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.",
    "Optional - if you want to get that nice golden look - 1 minute before you take the bread out of the oven, rub a small tsp of coconut oil on the top and broil on low until you get the color you want.",
    "Enjoy!"
