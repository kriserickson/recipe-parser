    "One at a time, bread the mozzarella sticks by dipping them in the flour mixture, then the egg wash, then in the bread crumbs, and then the egg wash and breadcrumbs once more for an extrathick breading. Arrange the breaded cheese sticks on a baking tray lined with wax paper and freeze for at least 1 hour.",
    "When ready to serve, heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or electric deep fryer to 350Â°F. Working with a few cheese sticks at a time, fry them until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels. Enjoy warm with marinara sauce or ranch dressing."
