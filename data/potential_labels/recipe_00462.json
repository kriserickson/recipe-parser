    "Place the steak in 9x13 inch pan. Add the garlic, half of the chopped onion, the smoked paprika, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper and olive oil. Use your hand to massage the seasoning into the steak for about 3-5 minutes.",
    "Heat a large heavy bottom skillet over high heat and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Sear the meat on both sides. Once the meat has been seared on both sides place it in the bowl of your crockpot. To the crockpot add the remaining, onion, diced jalapeño, orange, limes, cilantro and beer, toss well. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours or on high for 4 hours. Remove the meat and place it on a cutting board. Let rest 15 minutes and then shred the meat with two forks. Keep warm.",
    "About 45 minutes before you are ready to eat make the fries. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.",
    "Place cut potatoes in a large bowl and drizzle with oil, chipotle chile powder, oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt and pepper. Gently toss with your hands or two spatulas to evenly coat. Spread on a baking sheet in one layer. Bake for 15-20 minutes, then flip and bake for 15-20 minutes more. You want the potatoes to be crispy, but not burnt. If you want perfectly crisp fries I recommend spreading the potatoes on a greased wire rack and baking them as directed above. But this way is a bit of a pain. Keep the potato fries warm until ready to serve.",
    "To make the pico de gallo. Combine the the ingredients in a bowl and mix. Taste and season with salt and pepper.",
    "To assemble, spread the carne asada along the middle of a warmed tortilla. Top with pico de gallo, mashed avocados, a good handful of fries, pickled jalapeños and a heavy dose of cajita or queso fresco. Pick up the sides and EAT."
