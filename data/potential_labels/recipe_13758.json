    "Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat and add olive oil. Add in what was left from chopping over the tops of the peppers, the onions, jalape√±o and garlic. Stir and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add in the chicken and the beans and stir to coat. Stir in the cilantro. Pour in 1/2-1 cup of the enchilada sauce and 2 ounces of the cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted and the mixture has come together. Evenly spoon the mixture into the peppers. [Don't worry if you have extra - save it for lunch!] Pour the rest of the enchilada sauce into the dish to surround the peppers and over top of the peppers. Add the remaining cheese on top of each pepper. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbly.",
