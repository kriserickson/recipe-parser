    "Preheat oven to 425 degres.",
    "Place the cheese in a med bowl; microwave till melted. LET IT COOL enough to handle with your hands; be patient, or you'll burn yourself (ask me how I know this.)",
    "Once you can handle it safely, add the cream cheese and egg and almond flour; mix with your hands until it forms a ball. This will be quite sticky at first; almond meal varies from batch to batch, so add carefully until you get the right consistency. If you've ever made pizza dough, you'll be surprised how much like flour dough it feels - and tastes! If you've never made dough before, don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.",
    "Set the dough aside. On a cookie sheet, spread a sheet of parchment paper. Carefully spread the dough out on the parchment paper; don't worry too much about making it fit the cookie sheet, just spread it out fairly thin and even. Place in oven and bake till edges start to turn golden brown.",
    "Remove the cookie sheet from the oven; top with your favorite toppings. (Be careful not to glop on too much tomato sauce, it's fairly high in carbs). Load on the meat, veggies and cheese, baby!",
    "Return to the oven on the top rack till cheese is melty and the edges of the crust brown nicely. I don't need to tell you what to do with it from here; I'm sure you can handle this part."
