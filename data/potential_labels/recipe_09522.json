    "This makes a two pound loaf. Follow the instructions that came with your bread machine in terms of which ingredients to put in the bread machine first. Use the basic setting. Make sure you check on the dough after five or ten minutes of kneading. Just pop the top of the bread machine and see how the dough is doing. It should be a smooth, round ball. If it’s too dry add liquid a tablespoon at a time until it looks OK. If it looks too wet, add flour a tablespoon at a time until it looks OK. Most of the time though, the above amounts should be just right.",
    "I made mine with the bread machine set at medium crust. It came out a little darker than I’d like. The next time I’m going to use the light crust setting.",
    "We found the crust to be extra flaky and the bread had a cake-like texture. It was great!"
