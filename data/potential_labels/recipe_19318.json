    "Make the spicy onions: Squeeze the lime into a bowl and add the onion or shallot, jalapeño, salt and sugar to the juice. Set aside while you make the black beans.",
    "Prepare the beans: Heat a large skillet, then add 2 tablespoons oil. When oil is hot, add the onion and bell pepper and sauté until soft and golden, about 10 minutes. If the pan looks dry, drizzle in a little more oil.",
    "Add the garlic and jalapeño and sauté until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste, chili powder, oregano and cumin, and sauté until fragrant. Add the beans and a few large pinches of salt and let simmer until the flavors meld, about 15 minutes.",
    "Taste and add more salt, chili powder and oregano to taste. Serve beans with tortillas and avocado and top with the pickled onions and jalapeño and some of their liquid, adding any of the garnishes you like."
