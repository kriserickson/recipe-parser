    "Melt the butter in a soup pot and saute the leeks for 10 minutes, or until nice and soft.",
    "While the leeks are cooking, put 5 cups of water and the reserved fish skin in a saucepan and bring to a boil, turn down the heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes.",
    "Strain the broth and add to the pan with the leeks, along with the potatoes, carrots, and half of the fresh dill. Cook for another 10 minutes, or until the potatoes are just tender.",
    "Add the salmon chunks to the soup along with the cream and allspice, and gently simmer on low heat until cooked through, just a few minutes. Add the remaining dill, and salt and pepper to taste.",
    "This soup makes great leftovers, too, the flavors will mature and get even better!"
