    "Put the chicken, the chunks of carrot, celery, and onion, and the parsley in a pot with cold water to cover by a few inches. Bring to a simmer, and simmer gently until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 to 20 minutes. Let the chicken cool in the cooking liquid. Remove the chicken, discard the skin and bones, and shred the meat into a large bowl. (Don’t throw away the cooking liquid—save it for a soup or risotto!)",
    "In a mini–food processor, combine the mustard, anchovies, lemon juice, and salt. With the machine running, drizzle in the olive oil to make a smooth, creamy dressing. Drizzle the dressing over the chicken, add the sliced celery stalk and leaves, and capers, and toss to coat. Arrange the tomato slices on a platter, season with salt, and mound the chicken salad on the tomatoes."
