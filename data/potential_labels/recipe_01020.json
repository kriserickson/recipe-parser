    "Begin by warming your soup pot on medium-high heat for a couple of minutes. Add the olive oil, and toss in the onion, carrot, celery, green chilies, and garlic. Give a good stir. During this time, add the jalapenos and tomatillos to a blender, along with the water. Pulse this down until you have a nice puree.",
    "Head back to your pot and add in the jalapeno and tomatillo puree. Cook down a few more minutes. Add in your cumin, oregano, salt and pepper, and give another mix. Add in the chicken stock. Mix well, then begin to ladle in batches, back to the blender, pulsing down into a smooth puree, or to a texture that you like. Return the blended soup back to the pot, add in the cubed chicken, half and half, cheese, and the beans. Cover, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cooking another 20 minutes or until you cannot stand it any longer."
