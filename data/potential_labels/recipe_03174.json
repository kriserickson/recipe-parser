    "Roughly tear a couple of large squares of tinfoil. Throw one of the fillets into the centre of each and fold up the edges to create a bowl shape. No need to pierce the top five times.",
    "Chop up the chilli, crush the ginger and garlic, and divide across the parcels with a squeeze of orange and splash of soy sauce. Scrunch them up tight and give it all a good shake to mix. Bake your fish for 8min at 200°C.",
    "While the fish cooks, grab a microwave steamer. Splash some soy sauce on your veg and cook for 3min.",
    "Take the sea bass out of the oven and unwrap it (don’t let the steam burn your fingers). Now split your side-dish across two plates and put the fish on top with a couple of spoonfuls of the spicy dressing."
