    "Place salmon in a baking dish and spread with mustard. Sprinkle with herbs, a little salt and pepper, then layer with a few thin slices of lemon. Add wine just so it just comes up a little on the sides of salmon, and bake at 425 degrees for 20 minutes. Serve with a wedge of lemon and a spoonful of sauce."
