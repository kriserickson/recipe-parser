    "Yellow squash is extremely high in beta-carotene as well as lutein (an antioxidant thatâ€™s particularly helpful for eyesight), but low in calories. Dark leafy greens like swiss chard are also high in beta carotene, and when combined with the natural sweetness of a banana (potassium, fiber) and dates (more fiber), completely disappear into a smoothie, meaning this drink tastes like a sweet treat, but is still good for you! And last but not least, a teaspoon of matcha tea provides both a boost of natural energy, and a sense of focused calmness thanks to the amino acid L-theanine."
