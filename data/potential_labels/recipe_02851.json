    "Remember the dry rub is as important to good BBQ as the sauce. When creating a dry rub you want to add seasonings that will add to the complexity of the flavor without being overpowering. Marlowe's BBQ sauce is sweet with subtle fruit undertones; this dry rub is spicy with a late burn. The 2 together combine with the smoke flavor of the meat to create 1 cohesive unit.",
    "Blend well, cover and store.",
    "Black Magic seasoning is an essential part of Southern cuisine and my kitchen is never without it. This seasoning adds extra kick as 1 of the components of Marlowe's BBQ dry rub, but it is also fabulous by itself.",
    "Try spicing up your chicken or fish by adding a liberal amount of this seasoning before grilling or pan-frying.",
