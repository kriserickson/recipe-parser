    "Preheat oven to 350 F (180 C.). Line a 6-cup muffin tin with paper liners, or spray with nonstick spray.",
    "In a small bowl, combine the avocado, agave nectar, lemon juice and lemon zest. Mix until smooth and evenly blended.",
    "In a medium bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir in the coconut.",
    "Pour the wet mixture over the dry and stir quickly to blend (it will begin to fizz and bubble right away; this is as it should be; do not overmix, as this will result in flat muffins). Use an ice cream scoop or a 1/3 cup (80 ml.) measuring cup to fill the muffin cups about 3/4 full (these don’t rise very much when baking, so the height of the muffins when raw is what they’ll look like when baked as well).",
    "Bake in preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, rotating pan halfway through, until a tester inserted in the centre of a muffin comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing to a cooling rack. Makes 6 large muffins. These freeze beautifully."
