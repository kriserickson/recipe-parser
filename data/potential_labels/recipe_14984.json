    "1 Prepare the zucchini: Cut away the stem from the zucchini and trim the bottom end. Slice the zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds using a mandolin, food processor, or your very best knife skills.",
    "2 Cook the zucchini in two batches: In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add half the zucchini. Cook without stirring for 4 minutes, or until some of the rounds are golden when you lift them with a spatula.",
    "Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper. Turn and cook 2 minutes more without disturbing or until more rounds are brown. Do this two more times. Not all the rounds will be browned but a lot of them will be. Transfer to a bowl.",
    "Cook the second batch of zucchini with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same way. Return all the zucchini to the pan.",
    "3 Season the zucchini: Combine the dill and lemon rind on a cutting board and chop them together just to mix them. Sprinkle the hot zucchini with the dill and lemon mixture, and toss well. Taste for seasoning and add more salt and pepper, if you like.",
    "4 Serve hot or warm."
