    "Combine yogurt and 1 cup flour in the bowl of an electric stand mixer. Mix until combined, scraping down the bowl as necessary until combined. Knead on medium high for 5 minutes. *see cook's note for hand mixing method.",
    "Slowly add additional flour as necessary to help dough come together. Depending on how thick your yogurt is, you may need up to an extra 1/2 cup of flour. (I used the entire 1 1/2 cups).",
    "Dust clean counter top with flour and remove dough from bowl. Knead a few turns until dough is tacky, but not sticky (it should not leave dough on your hand when you pull away).",
    "Roll out and top as desired. Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven for 10-12 minutes (adjust as needed).",
    "Cook's Note: If mixing by hand combine ingredients in a bowl and mix with spoon until combined. Flip out onto a well floured counter top and knead 5-8 minutes.",
    "If you do not have self-rising flour, you can substitute: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Mix together and use as directed in the recipe. - See more at: http://www.theslowroasteditalian.com/2014/02/2-ingredient-pizza-dough-recipe.html#sthash.eKl3O0WC.dpuf."
