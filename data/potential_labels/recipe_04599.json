    "Slice the butter (or margarine, as long as it's in stick form) into about 18 pats.",
    "Distribute them randomly across the surface of the cake mix. If you skip this step, the cake mix will stay dry and won't rise the way it's supposed to.",

    "Put the cobbler in the oven for about 30 to 35 minutes or so, or at least until the cobbler has a lovely golden brown color. Enjoy!!"
