    "Combine the butter, cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt and 1/4 cup of the hot pepper sauce in a bowl. Whisk to combine. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover and marinate for however long you want to. An hour or more.",
    "Heat an indoor grill (or outdoor, whatevs) over medium-high and coat with cooking spray. Add the chicken tenders and grill until cooked through with nice grill marks on both sides, about 8 minutes total. Remove from grill and roughly chop.",
    "Whisk the ranch with 1/4 cup of the blue cheese crumbles. Or buy blue cheese dressing.",
    "Heat up the tortillas in the oven or microwave and start crafting your wraps. Layer some chicken in the center, followed by bacon, eggs, romaine, blue cheese, cheddar, the dressing and a few more good glugs of hot pepper sauce. With your fingers, mix up the filling so the dressing evenly coats all of the ingredients."
