    "MEAT PREP: Cut the steak into very thin bite-sized pieces and place in a mixing bowl. Peel the garlic, ginger, and pears. Pulse in a food processor until a paste forms. Add the paste to the meat and stir to combine. Cover everything with soy sauce, brown sugar, and sesame oil - just enough to cover and marinate. Your ratio should be roughly 4 parts soy sauce, 4 parts brown sugar, 1 part sesame oil. Mix it all up and refrigerate for 30 minutes or so.",
    "MEAT COOKING: Heat a large heavy-duty skillet over very high heat. Discard remaining marinade and add the steak to the pan. Sear for a few minutes, flipping it around once or twice, until your meat has a really nice golden brown exterior. Set aside.",
    "BOWL ASSEMBLY: Arrange the rice, kimchi, greens, and steak in a bowl. Add the egg on top and sprinkle with sesame seeds, scallions, and Yum Yum Sauce. Mwah! You're a boss."
