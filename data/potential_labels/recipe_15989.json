    "In a large cast iron skillet, heat the olive oil briefly on medium. Add the chopped onions and sautee until they are soft (about 5 minutes).",
    "Now add the brussel sprouts. Continue frying on medium. Do not stir until the bottom side of the brussels turns golden brown and crispy (about 7 minutes); then stir and let the other side of the sprouts crisp up as well (another 6 minutes or so). The onions may turn quite dark, which gives a deeper earthy flavor. Add a generous sprinkle of salt and the garlic powder, toss.",
    "While the brussel spouts are frying, cook the quick cook polenta in boiling water according to the package instructions (add a little olive oil to the boiling water, if you like). Once cooked, immediately stir in the parmesan cheese (and if you need to, add a little hot water and a drizzle of olive oil to keep the polenta smooth).",
    "Transfer the polenta to a serving dish and top with the fried brussels sprouts. Garnish with a sprinkle more of the parmesan cheese and the toasted pine nuts. Enjoy!"
