    "1 Roast the squash: Preheat oven to 425F. Lightly brush two baking sheets with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk together miso, maple syrup, the rest of the oil, salt, and pepper. Add butternut squash cubes, and toss to coat.",
    "Spread squash out onto baking sheets with plenty of room between pieces. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown and crispy at the edges. For more caramelization, turn the squash at the 15-minute mark.",
    "2 Make the dressing: Mix together all ingredients in a small jar and shake well to emulsify.",
    "3 Assemble the salad: Toss the roasted squash (hot, warm, or cool), the dressing, and the remaining salad ingredients together in a large salad bowl. Serve immediately."
