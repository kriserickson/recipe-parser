    "For the tomato sauce: Add olive oil to large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Sauté onions and garlic until softened and lightly golden, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce and bring to a boil. Season the sauce with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and let sauce simmer, until slightly thickened, about 30 minutes.",
    "While sauce is simmering, make the meatballs. In a large bowl, combine ground meats, oregano, parsley, Parmesan, salt and pepper, eggs, milk and bread crumbs. Coat your hands with olive oil and roll meatballs, about the size of a golf ball. Makes about 16 meatballs.",
    "Add meatballs to the simmering tomato sauce. Cook until meatballs are no longer pink in the centre and sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes. Stir in fresh basil.",
    "While the meatballs are cooking in the sauce, cook spaghetti in a large pot of salted water. Cook until al dente.",
    "To serve spaghetti and meatballs: Toss spaghetti with tomato sauce and serve as a first course or pasta starter. Remove meatballs to a platter and serve as an main course with salad. Serve both with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Makes about 16 meatballs.",
