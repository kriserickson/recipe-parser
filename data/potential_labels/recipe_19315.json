    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "IF SERVING HOT",
    "Heat water in a tea kettle over high heat. Alternately, if you are doing 2 cups or a larger amount then you can boil the water in a pot and steep the tea right in the pot.",
    "Add 1/4 cupÂ Blue Butterfly Pea Flower Tea flowers into a mesh tea ball and add to a large mug (if 1 serving) or 4-cup heat safe wet measure (if making for 2).",
    "Pour the hot water over the tea ball and allow to steep for 3-8 minutes, depending on how dark you want the tea. (Do not steep for longer than 10 minutes to avoid the tea from becoming bitter.)",
    "IF SERVING COLD (ICED)",
    "Put 1 cup of ice into a glass, pour the hot tea (after it's steeped long enough) over the ice. Add lemon or lime juice, amount to taste. Garnish with lemon or lime wedges. Drizzle with honey, if you wish. Serve and enjoy!"
