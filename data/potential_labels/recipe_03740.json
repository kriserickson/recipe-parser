    "Put the teriyaki and chilli sauces in a shallow dish and mix together well. lay the salmon fillet in the marinade flesh-side down. Set aside while you prepare the rice and pak choi.",
    "Put the rice in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 20 mins until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the water â€“ 6 mins before the end of cooking, put the pak choi in a colander and sit on top of the rice to steam, covered with a lid.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the grill to high and place the salmon fillet, skin-side up, on a baking tray lined with foil. Grill for 4-5 mins, basting with the marinade, then turn over and grill for a further 3 mins. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and cook for 1 min more until the seeds are toasted and the salmon cooked through.",
    "Stir the spring onions and coriander through the rice and serve topped with the salmon fillet. Spoon over any excess marinade left in the baking tray, and add a squeeze of lime. Serve the steamed pak choi alongside."
