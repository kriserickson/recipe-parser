    "In a bowl or baking dish, beat together eggs with half-and-half, salt, pepper, green onions, and cilantro.",
    "Heat a medium or large skillet over medium-high heat. Cover the bottom of the skillet with vegetable oil and add a tablespoon or two of butter for taste.",
    "Dip the bread triangles into the egg batter, drain off any excess, and place straight into the hot pan. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side â€“ you want to develop a golden-brown color and the texture should be crispier than traditional French toast. Place cooked toasts on a paper towel-lined plate or rack to drain.",
    "In a small bowl, mix together ketchup and hot sauce to your desired heat tolerance.",
    "Serve toasts warm with a side of the spicy ketchup.",
    "*I like to use a country or pullman loaf for this. You want it to stand up to the egg batter and not get mushy, so I always go for a day-old loaf."
