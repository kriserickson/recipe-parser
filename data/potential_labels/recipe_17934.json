    "Prepare your chickpea tofu if you havent already and chill for 15 mins then cube. Blend sunbutter sauce with 1/2 cup coconut milk and set aside.",
    "Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. When it has heated, add cubed chickpea tofu and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. (You can toss the chickpea tofu in 1 tbsp cornstarch before roasting to make it crispier). Remove from the skillet. This helps the chickpea tofu hold shape and not get sticky in hot sauces.",
    "Add veggies and a teaspoon of oil and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. Add a generous dash of black pepper and mix in. Then add the chickpea tofu.",
    "Add the blended sunbutter sauce then use 1/2 cup of water to rinse out the blender and add the water to the skillet. Mix and cook for 5 minutes. Adjust salt and heat to taste. Add more water or coconut milk if it's thickening too quickly or for thinner consistency.(sauce thickens on cooling)",
    "Serve over noodles or rice, lettuce, with lemon/lime juice, sriracha or pepper flakes and cilantro."
