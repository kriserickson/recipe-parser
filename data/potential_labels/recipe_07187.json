    "Rub the skin of the sweet potato with a little coconut oil and cook at 400°F for an hour and allow it to cool. Next, scoop the flesh out and discard the skin, and then measure out 1 cup of sweet potato.",
    "Preheat oven to 350°F. Prep a large cookie sheet by lining with parchment paper.",
    "Add the first five ingredients to the bowl of your food processor and process until smooth. In a large bowl combine the oat flour, almond meal, flax, baking soda, and salt, and whisk well.",
    "Scrape the sweet potato mixture into the large bowl and combine well. Fold in chocolate chips. Drop tablespoonfuls of the batter onto a prepped cookie sheet. These won’t spread out while baking, so they can be spaced relatively close.",
    "Bake for about 15 minutes, or until bottoms are golden brown. They may seem way too soft/underdone when you take them out, but they will firm up. Take out of the oven and leave them on the cookie sheet for about 10-15 minutes, before transferring to a wire cooling rack."
