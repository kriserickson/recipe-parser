    "Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F.",
    "Rinse and drain rice and lentils. Then place in a saucepan, add water, salt and cardamom seeds, cover with a lid and bring to boil. Lower the heat and cook gently for about 30 minutes or until tender and all the water has been absorbed. Meanwhile, stir together cumin, chili, turmeric, salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice. Place the cubed aubergine and the spice mixture in an oven-proofed dish and toss to cover. Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes or until soft on the inside and slightly browned on the outside. Set both the black rice and lentil mix and the baked aubergine a side to cool. Now prepare the salad ingredients. Place the chopped kale in a medium serving bowl, add lemon juice and olive oil and massage the kale for a couple of minutes until soften. Add all ingredients and toss to combine. Serve with a dollop of yogurt."
