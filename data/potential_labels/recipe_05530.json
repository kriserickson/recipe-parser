    "METHOD",
    "Combine all poached chicken ingredients in a pot. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and bring to a gentle boil. As soon as it comes to the boil, turn off the heat and leave the chicken in the poaching liquid, still covered, for 15-20 minutes (depending on the size of the chicken breasts). Do not lift the lid during this time (or else the heat will escape!). The residual heat of the liquid will cook the chicken through perfectly and keep it nice and moist. Remove chicken from the poaching liquid and set aside to cool slightly before slicing. If it has not cooked all the way through, simply return it to the pot and simmer in the poaching liquid for a few more minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare all the salad ingredients and mix dressing ingredients together.",
    "To serve, toss salad with 2 tablespoons of the dressing. Thinly slice chicken breasts and serve over the salad. Drizzle extra dressing over the chicken."
