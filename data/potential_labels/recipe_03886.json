    "Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with at least 1 inch of water. Add the 1 teaspoon salt to water. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes or until potatoes are very tender; drain potatoes.",
    "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Transfer potatoes to a foil-lined 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Cool for 10 minutes. Using a potato masher or the palm of your hand (be careful not to burn your hand), lightly press down on each potato to smash to about 1/2-inch thickness, keeping each potato in one piece.",
    "Using half of the olive oil, brush on potatoes. Sprinkle half of the salt and pepper on potatoes. Bake, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes or until bottoms are lightly browned and crisp. Turn potatoes; brush with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle with the remaining salt and pepper. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes more or until potatoes are lightly browned and crisp. In a bowl combine cheese and parsley. Sprinkle on potatoes. Bake for 2 to 3 minutes more or until cheese is melted."
