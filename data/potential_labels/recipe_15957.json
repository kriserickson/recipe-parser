    "Make the cashew sauce: In a small bowl, stir together the tamari, lime juice, orange juice, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, cashew butter, and water. If the sauce is very thick, add more water as needed to thin to a drizzable consistency.",
    "Bring an unsalted pot of water to a boil and cook the soba noodles according to package directions. Drain and rinse well. This helps to remove the starches that cause clumping. Toss with a drizzle of sesame oil and set aside.",
    "Place a steamer basket in a large pot filled with 1 inch of boiling water. Add the broccoli florets and stems, the scallions, and a few splashes of tamari. Reduce the heat to a high simmer then cover and steam for 2 to 4 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender but still bright green. (If you prefer, you can roast the broccoli. Toss with drizzles of olive oil and tamari and roast in a 400Â°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.)",
    "Assemble bowls with the soba noodles, steamed broccoli and scallions, the carrots, tofu, cashews, and dollops of the cashew sauce. Serve with more tamari on the side and sriracha, if desired."
