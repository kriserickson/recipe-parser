    "Tip the beaten egg onto a plate and coat the tofu in it. On a plate, mix the cornflour, sesame seeds and seasoning and dip the tofu pieces into it. Set aside.",
    "Heat the wok and add 2 tbsp of the oil, plus the carrots, and stir-fry until tender, adding a few splashes of water if they start to stick. Add the chilli, garlic, ginger and most of the spring onions, and fry for a few more mins. Meanwhile, cook the noodles following pack instructions, drain, then toss into the vegetables, along with the syrup and soy.",
    "Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan. Carefully shallow-fry the tofu pieces, a few mins each side, until golden. Remove and drain on kitchen paper. Scatter with the remaining spring onions and serve with the noodles and a little extra soy sauce, if you like."
