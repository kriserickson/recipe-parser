    "Here’s a trick I learned to prevent sogginess! It’s super. Form 4 small foil rings (like this:)",
    "Then place them on a cookie sheet and put mushroom caps on top, like so:",
    "The foil rings will help the mushrooms roast more evenly, and they won’t be sitting in their own juices so they won’t get soggy on the bottom! I learned this as a trick for roasting beets, but I love it for large mushrooms as well.",
    "Drizzle portobello caps with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
    "Sprinkle a handful of mozzarella onto each mushroom cap, then top with a few slices of tomato and a sprinkling of basil. Then finish with another handful of mozzarella. (YAY CHEESE!)",
    "Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes, until mushrooms have softened and cheese has melted. Garnish with more basil and serve immediately."
