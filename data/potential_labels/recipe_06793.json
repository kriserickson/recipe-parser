    "Heat oven to 425° F. Place the potatoes in a large pot and add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil and add 2 teaspoons salt. Reduce heat and simmer until very tender, 15 to 18 minutes. Add the peas during the last minute of cooking. Drain and return to the pot. Add the butter, dill, 1/2 tea- spoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Lightly mash. Cover to keep warm.",
    "Meanwhile, combine the panko and chorizo in a bowl. Season the fish with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place the fish on a baking sheet and top with the panko mixture. Roast until the fish is opaque through- out, 11 to 13 minutes.",
    "Serve the smashed potatoes and peas topped with the fish and additional dill, with the lemon wedges on the side."
