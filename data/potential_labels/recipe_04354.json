    "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until al dente.",
    "While the pasta cooks, whisk the eggs until frothy in a large mixing bowl. Using tongs, immediately add the cooked spaghetti to the eggs, tossing vigorously to coat, and simultaneously cook the egg.",
    "Add the leeks, bacon, parsley, and sun-dried tomatoes to the pasta, and toss to evenly distribute.",
    "Divide among the plates, and top each portion with parmesan cheese and pepper."
