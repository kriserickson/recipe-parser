    "Mix all the ingredients in a bowl and add enough water to make a smooth dough. Cover the dough and set aside for about half an hour.",
    "Shape the dough into 12 smooth balls. One by one, roll them out, dusting the surface with enough flour, into circles around 6 inches in diameter.",
    "Heat a cast-iron or nonstick griddle. Spritz with some oil spray and cook each roti on both sides until reddish-brown spots appear.",
    "Serve with a subzi or chutney. Don’t leave these rotis standing too long because the garbanzo bean flour in them will cause them to stiffen up."
