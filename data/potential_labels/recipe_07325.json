    "Add in the garlic and stir for about 30 seconds until fragrant.",
    "Add in the rhubarb, tomato sauce, tomato paste, vinegar, 2 tablespoons muscovado sugar, molasses, garlic, smoked paprika, mustard, salt, and pepper.",
    "Stir to combine and reduce heat to medium-low/low and simmer uncovered for 12-15 minutes until the rhubarb is tender and easily mashed. Mixture should be thick.",
    "Remove from heat and let cool for at least 10 minutes, then place in your blender or food processor and [carefully! hot liquid!] blend until fully smooth.",
    "Return to the pot over low heat, taste and adjust seasonings [more sugar/salt/pepper -- I used 3T sugar total] if needed.",
    "Serve immediately or allow to cool then store in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 week. Or, allow to fully cool, place in a sealable bag and freeze. Thaw in the fridge 24hrs before using."
