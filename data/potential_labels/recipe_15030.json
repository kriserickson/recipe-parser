    "Heat ghee or oil in a pan under medium-high heat. Put in cumin seeds and pinch of hing and shake the pot up so they mingle. Once the cumin seeds start to turn darker brown and fragrant, turn the heat to medium and mix in garlic and ginger. Sautee them together for 30 seconds.",
    "Throw in cabbage and sautee. Put some water in the pan if you feel the cabbage is burning or getting too dry. Add the spices and cook for about 5 minutes. Next add the potatoes. Cook for another 5 minutes or until cabbage is tender. Add salt to taste. Turn the heat off and add lime juice and cilantro."
