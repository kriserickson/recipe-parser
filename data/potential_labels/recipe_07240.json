    "Scrub the exterior of the squash until squeaky clean. Slice in half across the middle. Use a spoon to scoop out all of the seeds and strings that hold the seeds into place.",
    "Pour pasta sauce into slow cooker. If adding meatballs, crumbled sausage or vegetables, stir them into sauce until well combined. Gently place squash, cut side down, into slow cooker, taking care that each half is submerged into the sauce at least a couple of inches.",
    "Cover and set to low for 6 hours.",
    "Once cooking time is up, remove squash (careful they will be hot and awkward!) to a plate and allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Once cooled a bit, use a fork to gently scrape out the \"noodles\". Return to sauce, serve immediately and Enjoy!"
