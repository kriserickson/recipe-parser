    "Bring the cider to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat and let set simmer for about 20 minutes, or until reduced by half. Keep warm.",
    "In a bowl slightly wider than the apple rings, stir together the milk and vinegar. Let curdle, then add the sugar, vanilla, flours, baking powder, and cinnamon. Whisk to combine. The batter should be thick so it wonâ€™t drip off the slices. If needed, add an additional tablespoon flour.",
    "Heat 1 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Line a baking sheet with a brown bag to drain the fritters. When the oil starts to ripple, it is ready. Maintain the oil at this temperature. Working in batches, toss an apple ring with a bit of the extra flour to dry the apple and help the batter adhere. Dip the apple ring in the batter and coat it well. Fry the ring until golden, about 3 to 5 minutes. Drain on the baking sheet. Serve hot, dusted with powdered sugar in a pool of cider reduction."
