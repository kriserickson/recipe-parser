    "Remove the ribs from the kale by tearing away an inch or so from each side of the bottom of the stalk to form flaps. Then grab the bottom of the stalk and pull up. The whole leaf should come off.",
    "Stack the leaves in a pile and roll up like a cigar. Thinly slice the kale. Set aside in a large mixing bowl.",
    "Add the garlic, salt, lemon juice, and olive oil. Mix together with your hands until each leaf of kale is very well coated in the lemon mixture. Set aside for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until very wilted.",
    "Stir in half the avocado, peptias and cranberries. Taste for seasoning and add more salt as necessary.",
    "Transfer the salad to a platter and garnish with the remaining avocado, pepitas and cranberries."
