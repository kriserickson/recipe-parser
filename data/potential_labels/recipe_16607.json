    "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook the pasta until al dente, according to package instructions. Drain the pasta and set it aside.",
    "While the pasta is cooking, combine the butter, tomatoes and salt in a large, skillet over medium heat. Cover the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the tomatoes have started to burst out of their skins (about 6 to 12 minutes).",
    "To the skillet, add the minced garlic, green onion, white wine and grilled corn. Reduce to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes.",
    "Add the drained pasta to the skillet and stir to combine. Add salt to taste then cook until heated through. Serve warm with fresh basil and cashew parmesan and enjoy!"
