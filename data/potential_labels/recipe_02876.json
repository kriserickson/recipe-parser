    "Mix all of the dry rub ingredients together in a small bowl. Dab the brisket dry with paper towels. Coat the brisket all over with the dry rub. Make a mesquite fire inside the oven of a smoker. A combination of charcoal and mesquite chips (wet) is fine. Put the brisket on the right side of the grates in the main oven of the smoker. Damp down the fire. Leave the brisket to smoke until the fire burns out.",
    "In the meantime, In a large skillet, saute the bacon and vegetables until they are moist. Put them into a 6-inch deep, full-sized, hotel pan. Add the brisket, beer, vinegar, Worcestershire and garlic. Cover the pan with a sheet of parchment paper and tightly cover with a sheet of heavy foil. Cook overnight in a 250 degree F oven.",
    "Cut the brisket into chunks and serve on a whole-wheat buns with the BBQ sauce, sliced red onion and pickles.",
    "Heat some oil (about 1/4 cup or less) in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and saute for a couple of minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to slow boil - be careful not to burn. Cook on ultra low heat for about 8 hours (1.5 in prep room hot plate). Cool. Add the sauce to a food processor and blend to combine. Dilute with brisket pan juice before using.",
