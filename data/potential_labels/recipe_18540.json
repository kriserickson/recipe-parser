    "Add quinoa, water, and salt to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 5 minutes. Turn the heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until water is absorbed. Remove from heat and fluff with a fork. Let cool quinoa cool to room temperature.",
    "In a large bowl, combine quinoa, mango, currants, almonds, and mint. In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice, zest, olive oil, and agave. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Drizzle over quinoa salad. Toss until ingredients are well dressed. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.",
    "Note-this salad is good served at room temperature or chilled. If you don't need the salad to be vegan, you can use honey instead of agave in the dressing. Regular almonds also work in this salad."
