    "METHOD",
    "1. Add the dried porcini mushrooms to 300ml boiling water and leave to soak.",
    "2. Heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan set over medium heat. Add the spinach and cook for 2 minutes, stirring, you may have to do this in batches depending on the size of your frying pan. Tip spinach into a sieve set over a bowl, and press out all of the moisture with the back of a wooden spoon. Tip the spinach onto a board and finely chop. Put in a large bowl and set aside.",
    "3. Using a perforated spoon, gently remove the porcini mushrooms from the hot water. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve and reserve the liquid to use as stock later.",
    "4. Put the frying pan back on the heat and add a good splash of olive oil. Fry the porcini and fresh mushrooms over a high heat for 3-4 minutes until they begin to brown.",
    "5. Reduce the heat to medium and pour over the stock from the porcini mushrooms. Add the garlic, thyme and lemon juice. Continue to cook the mushrooms until all the liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are shiny. Remove from heat, spread on to a plate and allow to cool.",
    "6. Stir the ricotta and mushrooms into the spinach. Add two-thirds of the parmesan, a pinch of nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and put in the fridge.",
    "7. Preheat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3.",
    "8. Slice the tops of the tomatoes, about a third of the way down. Reserve the tops to use as lids. Using a teaspoon, carefully scoop the pulp out of the tomatoes, reserving it for the dressing.",
    "9. Fold the egg yolk into the cheese and spinach mixture. Stuff the tomatoes with the mix, piling it up well but without pressing down as this may cause the tomatoes to split.",
    "10. Sprinkle the rest of the parmesan on top and replace the tomato tops, tilting them at a jaunty angle. Carefully place the tomatoes in an ovenproof dish and drizzle with olive oil. Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the filling is heated through.",
    "11. Meanwhile, make the dressing. Combine the reserved tomato juice and pulp with the mustard, vinegar, oil and basil. Whisk together and pour over the cooked tomatoes before serving."
