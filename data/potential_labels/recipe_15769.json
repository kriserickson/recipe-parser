    "Add all ingredients except sweetener to a mixing bowl and whisk vigorously to combine. If not blending (which I preferred!), sweeten to taste with maple syrup at this time. If blending, you can sweeten later with maple syrup or dates.",
    "Let rest covered in the fridge overnight or at least 3-5 hours (or until it's achieved a pudding-like consistency).",
    "If blending, add to a blender and blend until completely smooth and creamy, scraping down sides as needed. Sweeten to taste.",
    "Leftovers keep covered in the fridge for 2-3 days, though best when fresh.",
    "Serve chilled with desired toppings, such as fruit, granola, or coconut whipped cream."
