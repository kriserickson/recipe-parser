    "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Using kitchen shears, remove any rib bones that extend beyond each breast. Working with 1 breast at a time, place skin side down on counter with breast side facing your knife hand. Pres on breast with your opposite hand to flatten slightly and, using sharp paring knife, cut 3-inch-long horizontal pocket in the side of the breast, stopping 1/2 inch from end so halves remain attached. Using your fingers and tip of knife, make interior of pocket wider without increasing 3-inch opening. Season breasts inside and out with salt and pepper; set aside.",
    "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12 inch oven safe nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and 1/8 teaspoon salt and cook until softened and browned around edges, 4-6 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.",
    "Combine lemon juice, garlic, thyme, mustard, rosemary, and 2 tablespoons oil in bowl; set aside 2 teaspoons oil mixture for sauce. Stir salami, Parmesan, capers, onion, 1 tsp pepper, and 1/4 tsp salt into remaining oil mixture, mashing against side of bowl with back of spoon until stuffing mixture clumps together.",
    "Place about 3 tablespoons stuffing mixture into pocket of each breast, pressing into ends of pockets with your fingers to fill completely and evenly. Fold breast over to enclose. Secure each breast with 3 evenly spaced pieces of kitchen twine. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.",
    "Bake chicken breasts with broth (optional). Bake until the thickest part of stuffing registers 160 degrees, 30 -37 minutes. Transfer breasts to carving board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 15 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, pour pan juices into liquid measuring cup and skim off fat. Stir in lemon juice and reserved oil mixture; season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice chicken breasts 1/2 inch thick, transfer to serving platter and drizzle with sauce. Serve."
