    "Mix the mayonnaise, Splenda, vinegar and seasonings in a large bowl. Mix in the cabbage and carrot, stirring to coat well. Chill several hours before serving.",
    "TIP: It may not look like the sauce will be enough to coat that much cabbage. It will be plenty, as you'll see after it has chilled a few hours. An easier way to get the sauce evenly mixed into the slaw is to put about 1/3 of the cabbage in a large bowl and blend in all of the sauce. Now add another 1/3 of the cabbage and mix well, then repeat with the remaining cabbage.",
