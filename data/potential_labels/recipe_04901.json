    "In a large bowl pour 2 tbsp of flour, all the water, the yeast, the sugar, stir and let the mixture for 15 minutes until it gets frothy. Keep a small glass of flour for later",
    "Pour 1 tbsp of oil, sift the remaining flour and stir while adding the salt. Begin kneading and add another tbsp of oil.",
    "While the dough is relatively moist, pour on a clean bench the remaining flour that youâ€™ve saved and continue kneading for 10 minutes",
    "When finished with kneading store the dough in a covered bowl in a warm place for about 40 minutes",
    "When the time is up, put the dough in a pan smeared with oil, add the sesame and a little flour, make a cross on the top of the dough and bake at 180 degrees for 50-60 minutes.",
    "5 minutes before you put the dough in the pan, turn the oven to 180 degrees, put in a clay pot with a little water and leave it throughout the cooking. It will help the baking process.",
    "When the bread is ready, wrap it with a towel and let it cool for about 15 minutes before enjoying"
