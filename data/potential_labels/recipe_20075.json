    "Step 1",
    "In a large skillet heat 3 Tbsp. oil over medium-high until smoking. Pat skin side of fish dry with a paper towel. Season with salt. Sear fish skin side down until well-browned and moves freely in the pan. (Hold your nerve and really let it fry about 7 minutes to get a crispy skin.)",
    "Step 2",
    "Remove pan from heat and, with conviction, flip the fish and let flesh side briefly kiss hot pan (about 1 minute). Transfer to a serving dish skin side up.",
    "Step 3",
    "Wipe out skillet. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil over medium until shimmering. Add onion, fennel, plus a pinch of salt and black pepper. Cook 7 to 8 minutes or until vegetables are translucent and starting to brown. Add wine. Bring to boiling; reduce by half. Add chicken stock; return to boiling. Remove from heat. Add the lettuce, allowing hot stock mixture to wilt it.",
    "Step 4",
    "Ladle into bowls. Top with salmon, fennel fronds, and snap peas. If desired, drizzle with additional olive oil. Serves 4."
