    "Season steak strips with salt and pepper and cook on skillet over medium heat until fully cooked.",
    "Place a dry griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Place a tortilla on the skillet and sprinkle with cheese. Add 2-4 strips of carne asada (charbroiled steak), roasted chilies, and tomato (if desired). Top with more Manchego cheese. Place another tortilla on top. Cook until light golden, about 1-2 minutes. Flip over and cook until golden brown."
