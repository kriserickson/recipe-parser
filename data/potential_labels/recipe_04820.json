    "Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Season liberally with salt. Turn the heat down to a slow-boil. Add gnocchi. Give them a stir to make sure they don’t stick together. Cook of 3-4 minutes until dough is cooked through and the gnocchi float to the top. Drain. While they are cooking, make the brown butter and toast the hazelnuts.",
    "Heat a medium non-stick pan over a medium heat. Add hazelnuts and cook until slightly toasted. Be careful not to burn. Remove from pan and return pan to stove.",
    "In the same pan, add butter. Let the butter melt, and when it starts to become brown, swirl the pan until it’s a deep brown and smells nutty.",
    "Season with a little bit of salt",
    "Add gnocchi and thyme leaves to brown butter. Once the gnocchi are completely coated in the sauce, let them crisp up on each side.",
    "Once the gnocchi are crisp transfer them to a serving dish and drizzle with remaining brown butter. Top with toasted hazelnuts and grated parmesan cheese."
