    "Make the ricotta, place the half block of tofu in a paper towel and squeeze over the sink to get some of the liquid out. Get as much out as you can. Now place the tofu and the remaining ricotta ingredients into a food processor. Pulse for 30 seconds or 1 minute until smooth but still has a little texture and looks like ricotta. Taste and adjust seasoning.",
    "Now take one slice of bread and spread a good amount of vegan ricotta onto the bread, top with fresh basil, blackberries and a drizzle of agave.",
    "Heat the olive oil in a large cast iron skillet or regular skillet on medium high. Place the sandwich in the pan and place something heavy on top for a minute or two( I like to use another cast iron skillet) press down as it cooks. When one side is brown, flip over and press again.",
    "Once the sandwich is nice and brown and warm serve immediately. Repeat with as many sandwiches as you want to make."
