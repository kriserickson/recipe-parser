    "POTATOES: Heat a large skillet to medium high heat. Add the olive oil, potatoes, and half of the spices and salt; saute until golden brown and tender-crisp. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.",
    "TURKEY: In the same pan, add the turkey and half of the spices and salt. Break apart into small pieces until fully cooked. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.",
    "EGGS: In the same pan, with the heat tuned to low, add the eggs and push around gently in the pan until barely scrambled. Add the potatoes, turkey, half the cheese, and ½ cup of the poblano sauce to the pan with the eggs. Stir to combine.",
    "ASSEMBLY: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x13 pan and spread a thin layer of poblano sauce over the bottom. Fill each tortilla with the egg/turkey/potato mixture and roll up; place seam side down in the baking dish. Cover with remaining poblano sauce and cheese.",
    "BAKING: Bake for 20 minutes until bubbly and hot. Serve immediately (but this also makes great leftovers)."
