Bake at 375ยบ 45 to 60 minutes for a single large loaf or about 30-35 minutes for the mini loaves or until the internal temperature reads 140-145ยบ.",

    "These have wonderful flavor. I made mini meatloaves as you can see in the photo. The original recipe said to bake them 40 minutes, but I think that 30 would be better. They were a little dry by the time I checked them and they were over 145ยบ by then. I baked mine on baking sheet that I'd lined with Reynold's Release foil thinking that would make for easy cleanup. The foil was a little too narrow to cover the whole pan and up the sides so some of the grease went under the foil. Cleanup was still much easier than it would have been without the foil, but next time I will line a 9x13\" cake pan with deeper sides."
