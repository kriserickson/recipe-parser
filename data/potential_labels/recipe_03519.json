    "In a large bowl combine the flour and salt. Make a hole in the flour, like a well. Crack the eggs into the hole. Using you hands or large spoon mash the eggs and flour together making a coarse and crumbly mixture. Add the water. Mix again until you have a nice, stiff dough. Knead the dough a few minutes to get it nice and smooth (5-10 min.) You may need to dust it with a little flour to keep it from sticking to your hands. When you are satisfied with your ball of noodle dough cover it with a tea towel and let it rest for about 20 minutes. This is to relax the gluten in the dough, making it easier to roll out.",
    "Use a rolling pin and a floured surface roll dough out real thin, as the noodles will poof out when they cook. Cut into strips or the the shape you want. Let the noodles rest and dry for about 20-30 min if you can. Cook in a broth that's boiling and then reduce to simmer for 25-30 minutes."
