    "almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda and salt. Process until a dough forms. Allow dough to sit for 5 minutes. You can also mix by hand or use an electric mixer, but I find the food processor to be the easiest!",
    "Next use your hands to roll dough into golf sized balls. Place on prepared cookie sheet then flatten each dough ball with the palm of your hand or use the bottom of a glass to flatten. Bake for 8-10 minutes. Remove from oven, transfer to a wire rack and allow cookies to cool completely before frosting. Makes about 15 cookies.",
    "For the frosting: Beat butter, powdered sugar and vanilla on high until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Frost each cookie then decorate however your heart desires."
