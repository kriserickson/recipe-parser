    "Pre-heat the oven to 180째C/350째F/Gas Mark 4. Grease and line the base of a 23cm (9\") spring form or loose bottomed cake tin.",
    "Place the biscuits in a plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin until fine crumbs are formed. Melt the butter and stir into the crumbs and mix well. Tip into the cake tin then use the back of a spoon to flatten over the base. Bake for 10 minutes. Allow the tin to cool.",
    "Reduce oven to 160째C/325째F/Gas Mark 3.",
    "In a large bowl beat together the soft cheese and the sugar. Add the soured cream and flour and mix well. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Pour the mixture into the cake tin then bake for 45 minutes (the cheesecake should be just set with a slight wobble). Turn off the oven, leave the oven door slightly ajar and allow to cool.",
