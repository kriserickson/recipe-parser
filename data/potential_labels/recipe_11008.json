    "Whisk together water, salt, and sugar until dissolved. Prepare salmon by removing skin and pin bones and cover with brine. Refrigerate for 2 hours.",
    "While salmon is brining, whisk together miso, maple syrup, red wine vinegar, and smoked paprika in a small bowl.",
    "Discard brine and thoroughly rinse salmon. Place in a vacuum seal pouch with ½ of the miso sauce and seal. Cook sous vide for 20 minutes at 122°F. Start broiler preheating at the same time.",
    "When salmon is cooked, open bag and discard liquid. Place salmon on a baking sheet, brush a small amount of sauce over the top, and broil until the top starts to brown. Alternatively, you can brown the top of the salmon with a blowtorch or kitchen torch.",
