    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a 10-inch cast iron skillet, add oil and sauté the diced chicken with salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and garlic until chicken is no longer pink, about 6-8 minutes. Remove from skillet and put in a bowl, then add diced onion to the skillet with a big pinch of salt. Cook over medium heat, letting sit for 5 minutes without stirring so you get some browning.",
    "Then add 2 tablespoons white wine, 2 sprigs of thyme and stir, deglazing the pan and continuing to cook for 8-10 minutes, until onions are very soft. Remove from heat, discard the thyme sprigs. Add chicken back to skillet, then stir in remaining 2 tablespoons of white wine, chicken stock, sour cream, 1 cup cheese, black pepper and minced thyme from the remaining sprig. Spread to make smooth, then top evenly with remaining 1 cup of cheese.",
    "Bake for 15-18 minutes, until cheese is browned and bubbly. Sprinkle with extra thyme and a few cracks of black pepper. Serve hot."
