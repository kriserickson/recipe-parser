    "Grind the rice and blanched almonds in a blender with 1/2 cup of water. Break it up enough so the rice is smashed up and the water is milky. It doesn't have to be a paste, you just want pebbles of rice and almonds.",
    "Dump the mixture into a bowl with 3 more cups of water, the cinnamon, zest and juice of the lime. Cover it with a towel and leave it in the fridge overnight.",
    "The next day line a strainer with cheese cloth or paper towel and place it over a large bowl. Pour the horchata mixture over the strainer. (Alternatively you can just use the strainer, but you might end up with some extra rice or almond bits in your drink.) Squeeze the almond/rice mixture with your hand to get every last bit of milky liquid out.",
    "Throw out the pulpy almond/rice mixture. Now add the vanilla bean paste and 1/2 cup of brown rice syrup. Add the brown rice syrup, whisk it thoroughly, and taste it. If it needs more sweetening add more brown rice syrup. Once you're satisfied with the sweetness pour the Horchata into a jug and put it in the fridge. Serve it in ice filled glasses.",
    "It will keep for a couple of days in the fridge, but not much longer. And honestly, if you can leave it for more than 2 days I will be shocked."
