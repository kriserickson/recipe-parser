    "1 Combine the blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a medium saucepan. Give everything a quick stir to distribute the sugar.",
    "2 Cook the fruits over medium heat for about 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the fruit breaks down. The fruit should look like a syrupy, runny sauce. (If you want a smooth jam without chunks, use the back of a wooden spoon or a fork to mash large chunks of fruit.",
    "3 Remove the saucepan from heat. Mix in the chia seeds and let the jam sit for 10 minutes to thicken. Taste and add additional sugar or lemon juice to taste.",
    "4 Cool to room temperature, then transfer to a jar and refrigerate. The jam will continue to thicken in the refrigerator. Store for up to 3 to 4 weeks."
