    "Set up 3 rimmed plates for dredging. In one add flour, season with salt and pepper. In the next, add eggs and water, beat lightly. In the last plate, add panko. Season each patty with salt and pepper. Bread each patty, starting with the flour, then egg mixture, then panko. Take care to coat each patty evenly at each step. Place breaded patties on a clean plate to set up.",
