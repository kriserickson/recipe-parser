    "Wash the zucchini well and trim off their ends. Use a spiralizer or a mandolin to turn the zucchini into “noodles.” Line a large serving bowl with paper towels or a clean tea towel. Place the zucchini noodles in the bowl along with the red bell pepper.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk the peanut butter with 1/2 tablespoon of water and all remaining ingredients. If the mixture is hard to combine, add up to another 1/2 tablespoon of water, but be careful not to make the sauce too runny.",
    "Remove the towels from under the zucchini noodles. Add the sauce and stir well to coat the noodles completely. Serve right away. (Leftovers can be refrigerated, but water from the zucchini may seep into the sauce, making it pool in the bottom of the bowl; stir well before serving.)"
