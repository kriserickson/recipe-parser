    "Use a spiralizer to turn the zucchini into \"noodles.\"",
    "No spiralizer? No problem. Cut a thin slice off the bottom of the zucchini (lengthwise) to keep it from rolling around on the cutting board. Place the zucchini flat-side down and, using a julienne peeler or a mandolin slicer, cut the zucchini into \"noodles.\"",
    "In a large skillet, heat coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add the \"noodles\" to the skillet and cook, turning a few times, until hot. (This will only take about a couple minutes.) Season with sea salt and pepper."
