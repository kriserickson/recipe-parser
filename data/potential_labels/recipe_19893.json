    "Bring a large pot of water (about 4 quarts) to a boil over high heat. Add a generous pinch or two of salt, then the pasta. Cook according to the package directions, just until al dente.",
    "Meanwhile, warm 1 cup of the milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Combine the remaining 1/2 cup of milk and the flour in a liquid measuring cup, whisking away any lumps. As soon as you begin to see a little steam rising from the heated milk, whisk in the milk-flour mixture. Cook for 3 or 4 minutes, to form a slightly thickened sauce that has the consistency of heavy cream.",
    "Reduce the heat to low; begin stirring in the cheese (to taste), a cup at a time, letting each addition melt before adding the next. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the powdered mustard, stirring to form a creamy, smooth sauce. Remove from the heat.",
    "Drain the pasta and place in a mixing bowl. Pour in the warm sauce, then add the hummus and stir to thoroughly incorporate. If the mac and cheese consistency seems too thick, stir in up to 1/4 cup more milk."
