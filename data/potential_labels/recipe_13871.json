    "Preheat the oven to 400°F.",
    "Use a fork to pierce the potatoes in several places. Place them on a baking sheet and bake until tender, 55 to 65 minutes. Let the potatoes cool until they are easy enough to handle.",
    "Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise, then use a spoon to scoop out each potato half, leaving about ¼ inch of potato on the shell.",
    "Meanwhile, transfer scooped potato flesh to a bowl, then mash with garlic, plant milk, mustard, and nutritional yeast (if using). Add chickpeas and coarsely mash with the mixture.",
    "Add the shallots, capers, sun-dried tomatoes, and scallions to the potato-chickpea mixture. Mix well, then season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Fill the potato skins with the mixture and bake until golden, 10 to 20 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, make the tahini sauce: Whisk the tahini and lime juice with about ¼ cup of water.",
    "Serve potatoes warm or at room temperature drizzled with tahini sauce and topped with chives and scallions."
