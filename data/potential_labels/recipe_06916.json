    "Heat the milk in a pot. While it is heating, put the sugar, egg yolks and cornflour in a bowl and whisk to combine.",
    "Mix a little of the hot milk into the egg yolk mixture, then stir the egg mixture into the remaining hot milk. Add vanilla and cardamom pods, if using. Stir over a low heat until thickened slightly, then allow to simmer for another 40-50 seconds, stirring gently.",
    "If you’re not using the Crème Anglaise at once, cover the surface with waxed paper to prevent a skin forming. (It will keep in a covered container in the fridge for a week.) Gently reheat when required."
