    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "Place a medium pot over medium-low heat. Add the dry farro and toast for a couple minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. The farro should have a toasted, nutty smell. Cover with 3 cups of water, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 35 to 45 minutes, until tender (time will depend on whether you’re using pearled versus whole).",
    "When the farro is almost done cooking, heat the oven to 375˚F. Whip the ricotta with the egg, oregano, and salt. Place the cooked farro in a 8x8 pan along with the vegetables, basil, and ricotta. Stir until everything is well combined. Cover with the pasta sauce and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven, sprinkle with cheese, and return to the oven for 15 minutes; until cheese has melted and lightly browned.",
    "Serve with a sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan cheese and extra basil."
