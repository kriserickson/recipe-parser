    "Roughly dice the fennel. On a rimmed baking sheet toss the fennel and garlic cloves in the olive oil with a few generous pinches of salt and pepper. Toss with your hands to coat. Roast in the upper third of the oven for 30 minutes or until edges are browned. In the last few moments, add the rosemary to the tray, toss it around and bake just another minute to soften.",
    "In a food processor, combine the white beans, olive oil, lemon juice, pepper flakes, fennel fronds and parmesan. Add the fennel, rosemary and push the roasted garlic out of its skin into the processor as well. Pulse everything together into a rough puree. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed (we like lots of herbs, lemon and pepper). Turn the oven up to 450. Transfer the dip to a baking dish and sprinkle the top generously with grated parmesan. Bake for 15-20 minutes until the dip is warm and the cheese has browned.",
    "Serve warm with crostini, crackers, crudite, flatbread etc."
