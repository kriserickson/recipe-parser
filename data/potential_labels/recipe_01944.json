Stir to blend well, cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until potatoes are very soft and have started to break apart. Puree the soup in batches in blender or food processor until completely smooth. Return soup to clean pot over medium heat and stir in the cheese. Cook just until cheese has melted. Add salt to taste. Do not allow the soup to boil once the cheese has been added. Stir in the whipping cream and cook just to heat the cream through.",
