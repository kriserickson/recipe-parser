    "In a large pot of salted water, cook pasta until al dente. Reserve starchy cooking water.",
    "Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over a medium-high heat. Brown sausages on all sides, until almost cooked through, remove and cut into ¼ inch slices. You don’t have to worry about cooking them all the way through, they will finish cooking while the sauce simmers.",
    "In the same pan drizzle another teaspoon or so of olive oil and sauté the peppers and onions until slightly softened, about five minutes.",
    "Return sausage back to the pan and deglaze with red wine.",
    "Add tomato paste, tomato sauce, water, Italian seasoning, sugar and salt. Stir to combine.",
    "Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for ten minutes.",
    "Add penne to the skillet, toss with sauce. If needed add starchy pasta water to loosen the sauce up.",
    "Season with salt and pepper and garnish with grated parmesan cheese."
