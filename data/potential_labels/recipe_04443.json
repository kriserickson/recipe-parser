    "In a small bowl combine brown sugar, cilantro, chipotle chile, adobo sauce, salt, chili powder, garlic powder, & pepper. Coat chicken in the mixture, cover & refrigerate for at least 30 minutes & up to 24 hours.",
    "For the dipping sauce, stir all ingredients together in a bowl. Cover & let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes until the flavors combine. Meanwhile cover & soak bamboo skewers; skip this step if using metal skewers.",
    "Pre-heat grill. Loosely weave 3 strips of chicken onto each skewer so that they cook evenly. Place prepared skewers onto a plate, keep as much of the marinade on them that you can.",
    "Grease grill grates with a pastry brush & vegetable oil (may also use a paper towel.) Grill chicken for 5-8 minutes until cooked through, turning half-way. Serve with dipping sauce."
