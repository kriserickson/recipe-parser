    "Cut the steak into 1inch pieces. Cut the kidney into small pieces. Place them both in a bowl & add the flour, salt & papper & mix well. Mix in the onion, parsley, thyme & bay leaf.",
    "For the pastry, mix the flour, suet & salt with the water to form a soft dough, kneed on a floured surface. Take roughly a quarter of the dough for your lid & set aside. Roll out the pastry to about a 13inch circle. Place the rolled out dough in a lightly buttered 3pint pudding basin, overlapping the edges to seal against the basin(use some water if needed)",
    "Spoon the mixture into the basin, add the soy sauce & enough beef stock to come three-quaters of the way up the meat.",
    "Roll the piece of pastry you've reserved for the lid into a circle about 1cm larger than the top of the basin. Brush the edges with water, press firmly onto the top of the pudding & crimp the edges togeather to make a good seal. Cover the basin with a floured pudding cloth & tie tight in place with string( if you dont have a pudding cloth, a tea towel will do)",
    "Place some kind of trivet into a large saucepan & cover with about 2-3 inches of water & bring to the boil,once boiling, lower the heat so the water is gently rolling. Put the pudding into the saucepan & cover with a lid making sure no steam is escaping & steam for 4hrs. You'll need to top the water up from time to time when it gets low.",
    "Uncover the pudding, place a plate ontop of the basin & turn upside down carefully to release the pudding from the basin & serve with steamed cabbage & boiled spuds.",
    "You know that anything that takes 4hrs to cook has gotta taste good!!"
