    "In a large pot, toast quinoa over medium heat for 2-3 minutes.",
    "Add oil, onion and pepper to the pot and saute over medium-high heat for 3-5 minutes, until soft. Add garlic, parsley, thyme and salt and cook 1 minute.",
    "Stir in flour until combined (you don't want to see any white left -- add gradually and if there's a little left over that's okay). Whisk in broth and then milk one cup at a time, whisking and waiting until the soup has thickened slightly before adding the next cup. (You can dump it all in at once, too -- it will just take a little longer to thicken!)",
    "Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium (or medium-low) and cook uncovered for 15-20 minutes until quinoa is cooked, stirring often. Add corn and beans and heat through, serve."
