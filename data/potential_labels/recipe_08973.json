    "In a skillet, cook beef, squash and onion over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink; drain. Add bread crumbs, salt, pepper and thyme; mix well and set aside. In a saucepan, melt 1/4 cup butter. Stir in the flour and salt until smooth. Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat. Stir in cheese until melted. In a greased 11-in. x 7-in. baking dish, layer half of the meat mixture and cheese sauce; repeat layers. Melt the remaining butter and toss with bread crumbs. Sprinkle over cheese sauce. Bake, uncovered, at 350Â° for 35 minutes or until golden brown. Yield: 4-6 servings."
