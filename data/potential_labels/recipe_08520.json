    "Line a buttered 7-inch cake pan with parchment paper or a silicone liner.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour and sugar. Grate the butter into the flour and stir it in to coat evenly. Gently stir in the buttermilk. The dough should be quite wet.",
    "Spread the all-purpose (not self-rising) flour out on a small cookie sheet. With a spoon, scoop evenly sized balls of dough into the flour, making sure they don’t touch each other. With floured hands, coat each dough ball with flour and toss them gently from hand to hand to shake off any excess flour. Place each floured dough ball into the prepared pan, right up next to the other. This will help the biscuits rise up, rather than spreading out. You might need to do the above in batches.",
    "Pre-heat the air fryer to 380ºF.",
    "4. Lower the cake pan into the air fryer basket using an aluminum foil sling and air fry until lightly browned, about 22 minutes. Brush the tops of the biscuits with some melted butter and pop back into the oven for another 2 minutes or so, until nicely browned. Turn the biscuits out onto a plate, and then invert them again so they are right side up. Pull or cut the biscuits apart and serve immediately with some butter and honey if you like."
