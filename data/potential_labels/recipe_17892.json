    "How to Make",
    "First, you will turn your Instant Pot on to simmer and saute the garlic, onion, and carrots. Once they are soft and cooked you will add in your flour and stir together for a couple minutes. Now get out your measuring cup and put in 3 cups of broth and 2 cups of water into your Instant Pot. With the last one cup of water, you will add in your corn starch. Mix it up till the water is thick from the corn starch. Once thick you and the cornstarch is dissolved you will add it into your Instant Pot. With your chicken, you will pull off and pull into slices. You will add in 2-3 cups. Last add",
    "in the bay leaves, lasagna noodles (break into pieces), Italian seasoning. Close the lid and cook for 7 minutes. Once the timer goes off let the pressure cooker naturally release for 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes, you will open and release the rest of the pressure. Stir your mixture together and then add in your spinach and heavy cream. Stir together till the spinach till it is soft like the picture. Now serve and enjoy with your family."
