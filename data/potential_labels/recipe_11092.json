    "Put the avocado, tahini, vinegars, lemon juice, braggs, and garlic in a blender or food processor and run that shit until puréed. Dump it out into a jar or bowl and fold in the herbs. Taste, and then add salt and pepper to get that fucker just how you like it. Serve right away or stick in the fridge for later. Best used within 3 days of making so those herbs taste fresh as fuck.",
    "* We used parsley, tarragon, basil, and chives but you don’t need to go out and buy all that different shit. Just do 2 of any of those and you’ll be good to go."
