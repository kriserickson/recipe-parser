    "Add ground coriander and cook until the onions begin to brown, about 5 minutes further. Add the bourbon and stir, cooking until it's evaporated.",
    "Stir in the pumpkin, water, and goat kefir. Add the turmeric, cinnamon, allspice, honey, and salt and cook until heated through. Serve immediately, with toasted chickpeas on top!",

    "While the soup is cooking, heat a 12\" cast iron skillet or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Drain the chickpeas and pat dry with a paper towel. Add the chickpeas to your pan. Cook until beginning to brown, stirring occasionally. My chickpeas took about 10 minutes before browning. Once the chickpeas are beginning to dry-toast, add the coconut oil. Fry for 5 to 10 minutes, until the chickpeas begin to get slightly crisp and brown further. Remove from heat and add the hot chickpeas to a medium bowl. Stir in the sea salt, maple syrup, and cayenne -- coating evenly. Eat straight or top off your soup with these babies!"
