    "Set the tenderloin pieces on a cutting board and rub them with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper. Set aside.",
    "Make the guasacaca: In the bowl of a food processor, add the avocados, onion, poblano chile, cilantro, jalapeño, garlic, vinegar, lime juice and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Process until smooth; then, with the machine running, add 2 tablespoons of the canola oil, processing until smooth.",
    "Heat a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat until it smokes, about 2 minutes. Divide 1 tablespoon of the canola oil over the tenderloin pieces, rubbing it all over. Cook until all sides are browned and the internal temperature reads between 125° and 130°, about 10 to 12 minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board and rest the steak for 5 minutes, then slice crosswise into ¼-inch-thick pieces (about 16 slices total).",
    "Set the cleaned skillet over medium heat and add 1½ teaspoons of the canola oil. Add a tortilla followed by ½ cup of cheese, 8 tenderloin slices and another ½ cup cheese. Place another tortilla on top. Cook until the tortilla is browned, 2 to 2½ minutes, then use a metal spatula to flip. Cook until the other side is browned, about 1½ to 2 minutes longer. Transfer the quesadilla to a clean cutting board. Repeat with the remaining ½ teaspoon of canola oil and the remaining tortillas, cheese and steak. Slice the quesadillas into quarters and serve topped with the guasacaca and a drizzle of adobo sauce."
