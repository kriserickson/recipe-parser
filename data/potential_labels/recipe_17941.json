    "Fill and boil a kettle, and get all your ingredients and equipment together, ready to go. Put a large, shallow soup pan, one that has a lid, over a medium heat to warm it up.",
    "Chop the spring onions quite finely and put into the pan with the coconut oil. Turn up to the highest heat and cook for two minutes, until softened.",
    "Add the peas to the pan with the coconut milk, the stock powder or cube and 750ml boiling water, then cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, simmer, still on a high heat, for two to three minutes.",
    "Remove from the heat. Add most of the herbs, stalks and all, and the juice of the lime, and use a stick blender to blitz the soup until it’s super‑smooth.",
    "Serve ladled into bowls with a little olive oil and the rest of the herbs. Drizzle over the reserved coconut cream and loosely stir through the soup."
