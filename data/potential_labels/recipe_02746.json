    "Preheat oven to 350°. Line an 8×8 baking pan with parchment paper, making sure to leave overhang on all sides. Toast the cashews, sesame seeds, and flaxseed in separate areas on a different baking sheet until golden brown (10–12 minutes). Let them cool while you process the main mixture (directions below). Set aside 2 tbsp sesame seeds and 1 tbsp flaxseed after they toast.",
    "Process cashews and remaining seeds with oat bran, salt, and cardamom in a food processor until finely chopped. Place in a mixing bowl.",
    "Bring the maple syrup and coconut oil up to a boil in a small saucepan. Once boiling, cook them for another minute while stirring. Pour the maple syrup mixture over your cashew mixture and stir to coat.",
    "Press mixture firmly into prepared pan with wet hands (since it will be sticky). Top with the seeds you set aside and press to adhere. Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. This recipe makes 12 bars and can be stored for 2 weeks in an airtight container."
