    "In a baking dish, combine strawberries, sugar, flour, salt and mix to combine. Either divide the mixture into 4 mugs or ramekins, or keep it in the baking dish. Place cut puff pastry either over top of the mug or ramekin, or on a baking sheet, and brush with beaten egg. Place the mugs on a baking sheet and place in the oven (or just place the baking dish and sheet with pastry in the oven). Bake for 25-30 minutes, checking once in between to stir strawberries and see how the pastry is coming along. When pastry is golden and puffed, remove and let cool to the touch (about 5 minutes) then serve (or spoon the strawberries into the mug and top with pastry)."
