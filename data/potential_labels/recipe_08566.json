    "Soak the gelatine leaves in ice-cold water. Bring the milk and cream to the boil and remove from the heat. Squeeze the water out of the gelatine and whisk it into the milk. Place the Nutella in a bowl and pour on the hot milk, whisking to blend. Stir in the hazelnuts and divide the mixture between four moulds, making sure each one gets its fair share of nuts. Leave to cool, then refrigerate until set.",
    "When you are ready to serve, prepare the blood oranges. Slice off the top and bottom and set on a chopping board. Using a sharp knife, cut off all the peel and pith in broad strips. Holding the orange over a bowl to catch the juice, cut each side of the fine membranes to remove each segment, and place them in the bowl.",
    "Unmould each panna cotta on to a plate, add a few segments of orange and a spoonful of juice and serve immediately."
