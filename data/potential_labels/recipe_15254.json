    "To make the dressing, add the cashews, garlic and onion granules, nutritional yeast, mustard, horseradish, lemon juice and 1/2 cup non-dairy milk to a high speed blender.",
    "Blend the mixture until completely smooth — adding more non-dairy milk until you reach a nice thick, but still pourable, consistency. Depending on the intended purpose of the dressing, and how thick you like your dressing, add more or less non-dairy milk as desired.",
    "Lastly, taste for seasoning. Note that this dressing if quite nice with good amount a bit of freshly ground black pepper, so don’t be too shy with it.",
    "*Note: This dressing can also be made quite quickly, if you already have Cashew Sour Cream on hand. If using cashew sour cream, mix 1/2 cup of the sour cream with the remaining ingredients. Depending on the thickness and tartness of your sour cream, you may need to use more or less non-dairy milk and lemon juice.",
    "Refrigerate the dressing until ready to use. This dressing can be used as a dressing and/or as a dip."
