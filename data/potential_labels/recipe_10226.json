    "• Never use pre-chopped garlic.",
    "• Cut the garlic uniformly, and it will cook evenly. As Frank points out, garlic has a very dense cell structure, so you're going to want to cut it really fine in order for it to cook through.",
    "• \"You can never use too much oil,\" says Frank. \"You can always take it out.\"",
    "• The first two minutes of the cooking time is when pasta sticks, so that's when you have to keep it moving.",
    "• Wait until the olive oil is hot enough that when you drop in the garlic, it immediately starts frying. Prisinzano suggests starting to cook the garlic in the olive oil about halfway—four or five minutes—into the cooking of the pasta. That way, the garlic and oil will be ready for the spaghetti when you pull it out of the water at the nine-minute mark.",
