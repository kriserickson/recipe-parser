    "Woooo hooooo! The leaves are changing, the temps are cooler, scarves are out and……it’s football season! Whether you are enjoying the game at home with family and friends or engaging in full on tailgating, this hot dog chili recipe will please a crowd.",
    "This is a recipe that you can make ahead and freeze. It easily heats up in a crock pot for warming. I heated mine up in a mini dip sized crock pot. We have an outlet adapter for the car so I was able to keep it warming on the way to Clemson.",
    "The recipe that I use has evolved over the years so much so that I do not remember the original source. Most of it came from my father who used to own a country store/lunch counter.",
    "It is an easy recipe where you have most ingredients on hand….big plus!!",
