    "Start by cutting the chicken breasts into thin strips, this will help the chicken to fry quicker. Season and fry on a high heat, try not to over cook the chicken. Then add honey to add flavour to the chicken. Fry both sides of the chicken strips, and once ready tip the chicken onto a plate to cool.",
    "Now for the vegetables, add a large chopped onion into the pan, chop red pepper and crush three cloves of garlic. Fry all these ingredients for 5 minutes and then add the chopped button mushrooms.",
    "In separate pans cook the Long Grain Rice and Peas. Once cooked, drain the water from both and mix together the Rice and Peas into a bowl and leave to cool. You can choose your own spices really but whilst the vegetables are frying I added half a teaspoon of chili powder and a level tbsp of curry powder and started to mix it all together.",
    "Add your Rice and Peas into the pan and begin to mix! Then add 4 tbsp of soy sauce and fry on a high heat. Stir in your chicken and begin frying an egg for each person eating."
