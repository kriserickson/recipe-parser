    "Place the pork shoulder in your slow cooker and pierce the top several times with a knife or fork.",
    "Rub the pork with the sea salt. Then, pour the liquid smoke on top.",
    "Program your slow cooker for 10 hours on the low setting. You may need a few more hours if your pork shoulder is larger.",
    "Once the pork shoulder is fully cooked, remove it to a plate and use two forks to shred it. You can also drizzle some of the remaining liquid from the slow cooker on top, to keep the meat moist, then serve immediately."
