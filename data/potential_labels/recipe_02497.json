    "1. Preheat the oven to 200C/gas 6. Place the pine nuts on a baking tray and roast in the oven until golden, set aside to cool down.",
    "2. Trim the outer leaves and base from the cauliflower then cut into small florets. Trim the ends from the Brussels sprouts and slice in half, keeping hold of the loose leaves. Cover the raisins in boiling water, leave for about 20 minutes, then drain and set aside.",
    "3. Place the cauliflower florets and sprouts in a large roasting pan, scatter over the saffron threads then pour over the olive and garlic oils. Season well and mix together gently. Roast for 25â€“30 minutes, until the florets and sprouts are tender and starting to caramelise. You may find that the loose sprout leaves start to really crisp up; don't be alarmed, it adds a lovely smoky element to the overall flavour.",
    "4. Transfer the roasted cauliflower and sprouts to a serving bowl; add the pine nuts and raisins, season to taste then give the whole mixture a gentle stir to ensure everything is combined and coated in the saffron oil, and then serve."
