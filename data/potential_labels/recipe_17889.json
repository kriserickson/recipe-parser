    "Brown the meat with the seasoning in your instant pot using the saute function.",
    "Add the broth, pasta and enchilada sauce to the pot. You want the liquid to just barely coer the pasta - if it doesn't, add a little more broth.",
    "Place the lid on the pressure cooker, close the valve and set the pasta on high pressure for 4 minutes.",
    "After it beeps, let it release naturally for 3-4 minutes, then quick release the instant pot.",
    "Stir in the cheese and salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Optional: Top with fresh Mexican queso, or black olives. You can also stir in 1/2 C. sour cream if you want to make it a little more creamy."
