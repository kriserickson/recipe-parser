    "Combine all of the sauce ingredients in a small pan and simmer for a minute or two until it begins to thicken",
    "Place the pork chops in a shallow dish and pour over the sauce. Cover and leave to marinade in the fridge for 1 hour (if you haven’t got an hour leave them as long as possible while you heat up the barbecue)",
    "Cook the chops on a hot barbecue, turning regularly, for 30 minutes. Alternatively, roast in the oven at 200°C/180°C fan/gas mark 6 for 25-30 minutes",
    "Throughout cooking, spoon over any remaining marinade to baste. Once cooked, the chops should be sticky and browned"
