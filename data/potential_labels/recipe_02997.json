    "To cook lentils: Rinse lentils and discard any pebbles. Place lentils, onion, bay leaves in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Add additional liquid if needed. Drain the lentils, discarding the onion and bay leaves.",
    "To make tahini dressing: Using a blender or an immersion blender, combine all ingredients and blend until smooth, adding more water if needed to thin the dressing. Adjust seasoning to taste. Set aside until ready to use. Dressing can be made in advance and refrigerated, tightly covered, for up to three days.",
    "To make broccoli: Remove leaves and trim the stem of any discolored areas. Cut head into quarters. Use a mandolin, the slicing blade of a food processor, or a sharp knife to cut the broccoli, stem and florets, into 1/4-inch slices. Place the broccoli (including the little florets that break off while slicing) on a sturdy sheet pan, season with salt, and toss generously with olive oil. Spread out in an even layer. Place the broccoli under the broiler until it’s tender and charred and crispy in spots, about 3 to 5 minutes, shaking the pan once or twice. Watch it closely -- the thin pieces will cook quickly.",
    "To assemble salad: In a large bowl, toss the lentils and carrots with the tahini dressing, a little at a time, until the lentils are evenly coated. You may not need the full amount of dressing. Taste for seasoning -- add more salt or a splash of sherry vinegar if needed. Fold in the broccoli, then the parsley and feta. Add the pistachios before serving so that they don’t get soft. Serve warm or at room temperature. Tightly covered, the salad will keep well in the refrigerator for several days."
