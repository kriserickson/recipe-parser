    "Shred the potatoes, carrots and leek in a food processor. There are two ways to squeeze out the moisture: Transfer the vegetables to a paper towel-lined mixing bowl. Place 2-3 more paper towels on top, then weigh them down with a can or other heavy item to press some of the moisture out of the vegetables. OR wrap the vegetables in cheesecloth and wring out the moisture. You may need to do this in batches to really get the water out. The more water you remove, the crispier your latkes will be!",
    "Allow the vegetables to rest for 3-5 minutes, then squeeze out even more water if you can.",
    "Mix the vegetables with the eggs, flour and salt.",
    "Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Press 1/4 â€“ 1/2 c of the potatoes into a patty in the skillet. Cook 4-6 minutes, or until browned, then flip to brown the other side. Remove from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining latke mixture. Place paper towels between each layer of finished latkes to absorb some of the oil.",
    "Serve with applesauce or aioli."
