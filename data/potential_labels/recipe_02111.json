    "Take around 2-2.5 cups of crushed Krackjack (or 50-50) biscuits, put into the mixer with 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 2 tbsp powdered sugar and grind to a fine powder. Take out into a bowl, add condensed milk a little at a time, and knead to a pliable dough. (You may add a tbsp of refined oil to make the dough softer.) Set aside.",
    "For the filling, cream the butter and 3 tbsp powdered/caster sugar till smooth and fluffy, using a fork or wire whisk.",
    "Roll out the biscuit dough into a round, like a roti, but a little thicker (say 0.5 centimeter thick) between sheets of butter paper/ polythene. Carefully remove the top layer of polythene, spread the white mixture all over, sparing the edges by half a centimeter. Roll up carefully with the help of the underlying plastic sheet. Even out the edges, wrap in cling film, and put it in the freezer compartment of the fridge for 30 minutes. Take out, and slice the roll. serve at once or chill further."
