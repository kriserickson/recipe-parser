    "heat the olive oil in a dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. add the onion slices and lay them flat; sprinkle garlic evenly over onion, then lay potato slices over them. cook for about 3 minutes without disturbing while the pan heats up. add the crushed cumin and give it all a good stir. cover, and cook over a low heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring the vegetables every so often (the bottom of the pan should start acquiring a brown glaze - this is good!). in the last few minutes, add the wine and let about half of it cook off. next, add water (or stock) and 1 1/2-2 teaspoons salt, bring to a boil - scraping the bottom to loosen the glaze. lower the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until potatoes are tender and falling apart - 15-20 minutes",
    "add radish tops to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes - until wilted and dark green. let soup cool. then transfer the mixture to a high-speed blender and puree",
    "divide the soup evenly, and garnish with cooked millet, radish sprouts, garlic greens, sliced radishes and a squeeze of lemon juice"
