    "Bring the broth to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the rice, lentils, and a big pinch of salt, and return to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the rice and lentils are tender, about 40 minutes, adding more liquid a little at a time if all of it is absorbed before the rice and lentils are cooked. Meanwhile, cook the onions.",
    "Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onions and cook until deeply browned and beginning to caramelize, about 20 minutes (add small amounts of water as needed to prevent the onions from burning; you can also continue cooking the onions for as long as the rice and lentils cook for a deeper caramelization). Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes more.",
    "When the rice and lentils are ready, remove from the heat and let sit covered for 10 minutes. Add 1/2 of the onion mixture, cumin, chopped parsley, and remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and gently fold to incorporate. Reserve the remaining onions for serving.",
    "Wipe the skillet used to cook the onions clean, lightly grease with cooking spray, and return to medium heat until the pan is hot. Crack the eggs into the pan and cook to your desired doneness. Season the eggs with salt, pepper, and a dash of paprika. (Read more: How To Fry an Egg)",
    "Divide the rice and lentil mixture equally between 4 bowls. Place a fried egg on each bowl. Garnish with the remaining caramelized onions, harissa, and toasted pine nuts."
