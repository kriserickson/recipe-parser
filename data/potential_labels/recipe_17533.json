    "Fill a large pot with water, salt it well and bring to the boil. Add the potatoes and cook until soft.",
    "Remove from the heat and strain, then put the potatoes back in the pot on the heat. Using a wooden spoon, break up the potatoes on the dry heat, to steam off the residual water.",
    "Add the butter, cream and nutmeg and stir into the mash until the butter melts. If you have an electric mixer, put the potato into the mixer bowl, season well and whip on high for 6-8 minutes using the whisk attachment to make smooth, creamy, mashed potato. Otherwise use a conventional potato masher, it will just take a little longer to achieve the same result."
