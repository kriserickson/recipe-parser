    "To make the couscous, heat the oil in a pan. Add the onion and cook for 10 minutes over a low heat. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the couscous, pour over the stock and stir.",
    "Cover with a lid. Remove from the heat and leave for 5-7 minutes until all the liquid has been absorbed and the couscous has fluffed up. Stir through the lemon zest, juice, almonds and coriander with a fork, gently breaking apart any clumps of couscous.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the fish. Preheat the oven to Gas Mark 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Mix the olive oil, lemon zest, Moroccan spice mix and honey, then spread over the salmon. Season well and place on a baking sheet. Cook for 12-15 minutes until just cooked through. Serve with the couscous."
