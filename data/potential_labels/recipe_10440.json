    "ABOUT THIS RECIPE",
    "\"I got tired of the \"same ole' country fried steak, and was looking through a TOH \"country cooking\" and found one that was contributed by Toni Holcomb. I changed a few things and here are the results. Feel free to adjust the seasonings to your own tastes. I served this with mashed potatoes and green beans. The nutrition amounts include the total amounts of flour and milk mixture--you might not use all of the flour mixture to bread the meat and you might not use all the gravy.
