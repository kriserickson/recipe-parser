    "Peel mandarins carefully, try keeping peels one piece if possible. Then cut half of the peels (about 8 mandarins) into thin strips (julienne strips) and set aside. Remove as much of the pith as possible and set aside.",
    "Cut the mandarins half crosswise, remove the seeds and set aside too. Use a clean handkerchief or muslin cloth, wrap the seeds and pith together tightly.",
    "Add mandarins, peel strips, the parcel of pith and seeds, lemon juice, sugar, water into a large pot. Stir constantly over medium heat, without boiling, until sugar is dissolved.",
    "Bring to the boil, then reduce heat down to medium and let it bubble away for about 1 hour, stir occasionally until jell point is reached.",
    "Jell point Testing: Put a saucer in the freezer and chill it. Take it out when ready to test, add a dollop of jam onto saucer. Draw a line on the jam with a knife, if it wrinkles, then the jam is ready. If not, keep boiling the mixture for another 10 minutes and test again.",
    "Once ready, remove the parcel and discard the pith and seeds. Pour the marmalade into hot sterilised jars. Seal 15 mins later, or when the jars are cool enough to handle.",
    "Makes 6-7 150ml jars"
