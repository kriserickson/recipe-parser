    "Rinse the barley in a sieve and let drain while you prepare the remaining ingredients. Warm the vegetable broth in a pot on a back burner.",
    "If you’re using kabocha squash, it does not have to be peeled, just trim off any gnarly bits. Peel the butternut squash if using. Dice half the squash into 1/4-inch (0.6 cm) cubes, and the other half into 3/8-inch (1 cm) cubes. Accuracy in size is important. The smaller pieces will dissolve and the bigger ones will cook through by the time the rice is cooked.",
    "Heat the oven to 400 F (200 C). Toss 1 tbsp (15 mL) olive oil with the apple, sage, red pepper flakes and season with salt. Spread out on to a parchment lined baking sheet. Put the sheet in the oven 15 minutes before you start the risotto and cook for 20 minutes, turning the apples over once. The apples should be softened and lightly browned. Remove from the oven.",
    "In a large, heavy pot, heat 4 tbsp (60 mL) of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until the onion is translucent. Add the barley and rice and stir for a minute to coat the grains with the oil and onion.",
    "Add the squash and stir for another minute. Add a 1 cup (250 mL) of the broth and stir, regulating the heat to a gentle, bubbly simmer, until the liquid reduces and forms a creamy “sauce” around the grains. Season lightly with salt and continue adding cups of broth, and stirring. Taste and season as you stir merrily along.",
    "When done, the rice should be slightly firm to the bite and the squash tender and dissolving into the rice. It should be slightly soupy because it will continue to cook and absorb the liquid. Stir in the thyme leaves.",
    "Mix the miso with a little bit of the risotto to dissolve it then stir into the rice. Do a last check on the seasoning and spoon the risotto into warm bowls. Top with the apple mixture and serve immediately.",
    "Makes 4 main course or 6 side servings"
