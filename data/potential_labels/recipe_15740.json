    "In the blender jar, combine the tofu, lemon juice, sugar, cashews, and lemon oil. Blend until super smooth and fluffy. You will probably need to scrape down the sides of the blender. Once the mixture is smooth, with the machine running on low speed, add the Instant Clearjel through the top of the blender. Blend until smooth.",
    "Add the lemon zest and pulse several times to incorporate. You don't want to over-blend the zest.",
    "Refrigerate the mousse for several hours, and then serve. You can serve it in small glasses or canning jars, or layer with fresh raspberries and graham cracker or vanilla cookie crumbs."
