    "Start by steaming the vegetables for the topping so that they are cooled down for when needed.",
    "Preheat the oven to 200ºC ( 400 F ), Gas Mark 6.",
    "In a frying pan, add the oil and gently fry the onions, garlic, celery and carrots with a very small pinch of salt (to aid in caramelisation) until the onions have softened and become caramelised.",
    "Now add the cabbage and spinach, mix well and fry for a further 2-3 minutes. Shake over the flour and stir into the vegetable mixture and when completely stirred in, add the stock and all of the other filling ingredients.",
    "Cook on a medium to low heat until the sauce has thickened and the vegetables are a little more tender.",
    "Put to one side and prepare the topping.",
    "Put all of the topping ingredients in a bowl and mash together. I prefer to leave the mash a little lumpy as I like the texture from the potato and cauliflower.",
    "Put the dish together by placing the filling in a baking dish and topping with the potato and cauliflower mash. Bake for 40-45 minutes and until the topping is golden brown."
