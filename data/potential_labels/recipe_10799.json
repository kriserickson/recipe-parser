    "Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread, then stack buttered sides together. Layer 2 slices cheddar on top of bread stack, then bacon slices, then lacy swiss cheese, then tomato and finally the remaining slices of cheese. Place bread buttered side down in a fry pan over medium-high heat. Cover with lid and let cook for 3-4 minutes or until golden.",
    "Reduce heat to medium and flip sandwich to other side and cook for 2-3 minutes or until bread is toasty golden and cheese has melted. The second side will cook faster than the first so watch carefully.",
    "Cut in half and enjoy with homemade tomato soup!"
