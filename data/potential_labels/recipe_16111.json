    "Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Lightly flour your work surface. Divide the pizza dough into 4 portions then roll each portion into a circle about 7 inches wide.",
    "In a small bowl, stir together the ricotta cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, chives, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir in the chicken then divide mixture evenly between the four circles of dough, spreading the mixture on one half of the circle and leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken mixture.",
    "Fold the non-filled side of the dough over the filling to form a half-circle shape then pinch and seal the edges together. Transfer the calzones to the baking sheet, spacing them at least 2 inches apart. Brush the tops of the calzones with the melted butter then sprinkle them with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.",
    "Bake the calzones for about 15 minutes until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown. Remove the calzones from the oven and serve them with the marinara sauce for dipping."
