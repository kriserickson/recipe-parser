    "Drain the garbanzo beans of liquid. Pour the beans into a large sieve or colander and rinse thoroughly under cold water. Allow to drain.",
    "Mince garlic and finely chop parsley.",
    "Place eggs, milk, minced garlic, and garbanzo beans in a food processor and whirl until garbanzos are a smooth paste. Add garlic, paprika, salt and pepper and process for 20 seconds. Slowly add bread crumbs until mixture becomes thick and has the appropriate consistency to shape into small balls.",
    "Pour the olive oil in to a small frying pan,Â to a depth of about 1/2 inch. Heat on medium.",
    "Use a tablespoon to scoop up enough garbanzo mixture to form a ball about the size of a large walnut. Place flour in a small bowl. Roll balls in the flour, and place in hot oil. Fry and turn over, browning on all sides. Use tongs to remove, and allow to drain on a paper towel.",
    "Serving Suggestion: Prepare alioli (garlic mayonnaise sauce), romesco sauce or another Spanish sauce. Spoon sauce over garbanzo bean balls, and serve with toothpicks."
