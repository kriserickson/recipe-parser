    "Directions:",
    "1. Preheat oven to 350 for slightly chewy granola or 375 for crunchy granola. I prefer slightly chewy.",
    "2. In a small saucepan add shortening, honey and rapadura. Cook on medium heat until shortening is melted and stir until ingredients are combined. The rapadura will not melt and become one with the oil. When you stop stirring the rapadura will settle to the bottom. That’s ok. Just give it a quick stir right before you add it to the oats.",
    "3. In a large bowl combine oats and melted goodness.",
    "4. Spread evenly on 2 parchment lined or very well greased 9 X 13 pans.",
    "5. Put the pans in the oven and turn the oven OFF.",
    "6. Go to bed.",
    "7. Wake up and enjoy some delicious additive-free granola cereal. Granola will keep in an air tight container for weeks."
