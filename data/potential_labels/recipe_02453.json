    "Cut chicken into 4 equal size pieces. Pound breast so it is about 1/4\" thick.",
    "Mix together softened cream cheese, chopped green onions and shredded pepperjack cheese. Put 1/4 of this mixture into the middle of each piece of chicken.",
    "Starting at the long side, roll chicken breast up, keeping the cheese mixture to the middle.",
    "Wrap 1 to 2 slices of bacon around the chicken breast, secure with toothpick, if needed.",
    "One piece of bacon wrapped around each breast is enough. But 2 pieces of bacon for each breast fully wraps the chicken and is outstanding.",
    "Place on baking sheet and back for 30 minutes at 375 degrees F.",
    "Broil topside for about 5 minutes to fully brown and crisp bacon. Turn each breast over and broil for another 3 minutes or so to crisp up the bottom side."
