    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees . In a large bowl, beat the eggs, milk (or half-and-half), parmigiano-reggiano, hot sauce, salt and pepper.",
    "In a large, ovenproof skillet, heat 2 tbsp. EVOO over medium to medium-high heat. Add the eggs and keep moving and settling them as they cook. When the eggs begin to firm up, transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake until light golden and puffed but not cooked through, about 10 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, in another skillet, heat the remaining 2 tbsp. EVOO over medium-high heat. Add the soppressate (or chiles), garlic, onion and oregano and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine and cook to reduce slightly, 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and simmer to thicken, 10 minutes.",
    "Remove the frittata from the oven and top with the tomato sauce and mozzarella. Bake to melt the cheese, 8 to 10 minutes more. Top with the parsley and basil."
