    "Heat the oil in the skillet and saute the garlic and onion for 2-3 minutes, then add the (brown or white) rice and saute in the oil, onions and garlic for 3-4 more minutes.",
    "Pour in 4 cups of water and stir the rice into the water if necessary. (It will sizzle and steam up, call the kids over to watch!)",
    "Bring the water to bubbling, then add the undrained tomatoes, green pepper and drained corn. Mix in the diced chorizo. Cover tightly and reduce heat to medium. Cook for 20 minutes if using white rice, or 50 minutes if using brown rice. As noted above, if using brown rice, stir every 10 minutes and add water as needed.",
    "Remove from heat to keep rice from overcooking and fluff with a fork before serving.",
    "Note: season with salt and pepper after cooking, as chorizo is salty by nature.",
    "Serve Chorizo Rice Skillet Dinner, as is!"
