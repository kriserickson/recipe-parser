    "Follow the instructions on your ice cream maker to freeze your ice cream (I always add just a couple of minutes to the time listed for coconut milk ice cream). It generally takes about 20 minutes. If you don’t have an ice cream maker, you could consider trying one of these methods."

  "ingredients": [
    "0",
    "2 14 ounce cans of full fat coconut milk",
    "1 tablespoon of vanilla extract (such as this one)",
    "1 teaspoon cinnamon (such as this one)",
    "⅛ teaspoon each of ground nutmeg, cloves, and cardamom (such as this one)",
    "A pinch or two of unrefined salt",
    "½ cup of pure maple syrup (I prefer grade B - available here) or a combination of maple syrup and raw honey – raw honey is sweeter, so a version made with ¼ cup of each still has the maple flavor, and is also sweeter from the honey."
