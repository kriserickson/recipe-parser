    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.",
    "Whisk together cream cheese, flour, milk, Ranch dressing, onion powder and salt & pepper. Whisk in eggs. Add in ham and stir to combine. Pour into a 9x13 pan (or quarter bakers sheet like I used) that's been lined with foil and sprayed with non-stick spray.",
    "Bake at 375 degrees for 20-22 minutes, until edges are beginning to puff up.",
    "Remove from oven and spread top of eggs with cheese. Let sit 5-8 minutes until cheese has melted.",
    "Beginning on one of the long sides, gently roll up baked eggs. (Egg is easier to roll if it's cooled somewhat. Your egg might split and that's okay- it will still be fine!) Place roll seam side down on baking sheet. Sprinkle with a bit more cheese.",
    "Return to the oven for 5 minutes.",
    "Let cool for a few minutes prior to slicing.",
    "Serves 5-6."
