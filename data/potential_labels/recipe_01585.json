    "Grind: To make swirl, toss nuts, brown sugar, cinnamon, soda and salt in the food processor. Grind fine. Stir in melted butter. Scrape this paste into a small resealable bag.",
    "Mash: To make glaze, beat together butter, cream cheese, icing sugar and vanilla. Thin with a little milk. Scrape into a small resealable bag.",
    "Whisk: To make pancake batter, settle butter in a large bowl. Zap to melt. Whisk in, in order: egg, buttermilk and milk. Sift in flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk briefly. Let rest 10 minutes.",
    "Swirl: Set a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Slick with just a little oil. Scoop on batter, using a 1/3-cup measure. Nudge each pancake into a 10cm circle. Snip a corner off the swirl bag. Squeeze on a spiral of the nutty paste.",
    "Crisp: As pancakes cook, trace over the swirl with a toothpick or knife-tip; this will help the swirl sink into the batter. Cook until the centre of each pancake is speckled with popping bubbles, about three minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is browned, 1 minute. Keep warm in a low oven while crisping remaining cakes, adding oil as needed. Wipe out the skillet with an oiled paper towel between batches.",
    "Serve: Stack up two cakes, swirl side up, on each of 4 plates. Snip a corner off the glaze bag. Drizzle with glaze. Dig in."
