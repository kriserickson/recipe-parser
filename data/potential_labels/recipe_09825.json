    "Instructions",
    "In a saucepan, bring the water, oats and carrots to a boil, then turn the heat to low. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the steel-cut oats are cooked through but still chewy.",
    "While the oats are cooking, heat the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, then add the green pepper, garlic and spices and cook for another 2 minutes.",
    "Once the oat mixture is cooked, add it to the saute pan and mix the oats in with the veggies. You want to keep cooking until the oats dry out some and begin to separate. Keep cooking until it starts to look like crumbles.",
    "Mix in the kidney beans, green chilies and kale. Cook until the kidney beans are thoroughly heated.",
    "Right before serving, add the lime juice, cilantro and salt. Serve in hard or soft taco shells, or in burritos. They are also amazing on top of nachos.",
    "Note: Feel free to leave out the beans and replace the chili powder and cumin",
    "with basil and thyme. You can also leave out the green chilies and green pepper",
    "and replace with either sliced mushrooms or sun-dried tomatoes.",
