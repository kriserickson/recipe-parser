    "In a skillet on medium heat, add the oil, diced onions and a pinch of sea salt. Stir to combine then add the minced garlic and jalapeno. Cook on a low to medium heat for 7 to 10 minutes to help sweat the onions, be careful not to brown the ingredients.",
    "While the onions are cooking, strain and rinse the black beans. Give them a good rinse in order to remove the liquid present in the can.",
    "Once the onions have cooked, add the cumin, chili powder and oregano to the pan for about 30 seconds until fragrant.",
    "Transfer the onion mixture and black beans to a food processor. Add the chopped cilantro and lime juice, and blend until smooth.",
    "If the dip is too thick you may need to add a little extra lime juice or water to help thin it out. Just a splash or tablespoon.",
    "Serve warm or cold with fresh veggies and tortilla chips.",
    "Enjoy!"
