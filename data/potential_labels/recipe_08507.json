    "First, make the salsa. Mix together all of the ingredients (use 1⁄2 a chilli for a milder flavour, all of it for a pungent one). Set aside while you cook the gammon.",
    "Heat the grill for 3 mins. Use a thin-bladed knife to slice the gammon into 2 steaks, then snip the rind every 2-3cm. Lightly brush with oil. Grill for about 3 mins each side until just firm, then brush over the honey on one side and cook for 1 min more. Remove and leave to stand for 2-3 mins.",
    "Serve the gammon with the salsa spooned over the top. Good with a chicory salad or green beans and chunky-cut chips."
