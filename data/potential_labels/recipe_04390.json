    "Place the almonds in a blender (if your blender isn’t a powerful one, like my Vitamix, soak your almonds in water for a couple of hours first to soften them)",
    "Cover the almonds in the blender with enough soymilk to cover them by at least half an inch.",
    "Blend until you have a pancake-like batter. You want the almond paste to be slightly grainy, but without any big pieces.",
    "Melt the vegan butter in a skillet, preferably a really well-seasoned cast-iron or non-stick one.",
    "Pour the almond paste into the skillet.",
    "Add the sugar.",
    "Over medium-low heat, stir the paste constantly with a ladle to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.",
    "When the paste loses a good deal of its moisture and expresses the fat, turn off the heat. Stir in the cardamom powder.",

    "To garnish, heat the canola oil in a small saucepan.",
