    "In a small pot, add the oats, water, salt, coconut and sugar. Place it on medium-high heat, just until the water comes to a boil.",
    "Immediately turn the heat to low and place a lid on the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, until the oats are soft and tender and most of the water has cooked off. You can add more water if you like your oatmeal smooth and thin, or use slightly less if you want a thick oatmeal.",
    "Turn off the heat and squeeze the juice of half a lime over the top."
