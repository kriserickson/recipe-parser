    "Preheat the oven to 400ËšF. Heat a medium, oven-safe skillet or cast iron pan over medium-low heat. Add the olive oil to the pan, followed by the garlic. Cook the garlic until fragrant and golden; 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the chard, turn the heat to low, and cook until the chard just begins to wilt, 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "Stir the cannellini beans, stewed tomatoes, salt, and pepper into the chard mixture. Sprinkle the top with breadcrumbs. Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes, until the tomato sauce is bubbling. Place the dish under the broiler if desired to brown the breadcrumbs more."
