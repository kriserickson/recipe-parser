    "Pour milk into a large saucepan, and bring to the boil over medium heat. In a medium bowl, whisk together the semolina, cornflour, 200g sugar and salt so there are no cornflour clumps. When milk comes to the boil, gradually add the semolina mixture, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and comes to a full boil. Remove from heat, and set aside. Keep warm.",
    "In a large bowl, beat eggs with an electric mixer at high speed. Add 100g of sugar, and whip until thick and pale, about 10 minutes. Stir in vanilla.",
    "Fold the whipped eggs into the hot semolina mixture. Partially cover the pan, and set aside to cool.",
    "Preheat the oven to 180 C / Gas",
    "Butter a 22x33cm baking dish, and layer 7 sheets of filo into the dish, brushing each one with butter as you lay it in. Pour the custard into the dish over the filo, and cover with the remaining 5 sheets of filo, brushing each sheet with butter as you lay it down.",
    "Bake for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is crisp and the custard filling has set.",
    "In a small saucepan, stir together the remaining sugar and water. Bring to the boil. When the Galaktoboureko comes out of the oven, spoon the hot sugar syrup over the top, particularly the edges. Cool completely before cutting and serving. Store in the refrigerator."
