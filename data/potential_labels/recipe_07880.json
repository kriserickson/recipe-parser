    "Set cashews to soak in a bowl of water from 5 to 20 minutes then rinse and drain. 20 minutes is best but 5 minutes works, too!",
    "In a large pot, warm the oil over medium heat.",
    "Sauté the onion and garlic until they are tender, about 5 minutes.",
    "Add the veggie of choice, enough water to cover, the sea salt, and pepper. Simmer 8 to 10 minutes, until and the vegetables are tender and soft.",
    "Transfer the soup to a blender (see Note), working in batches if necessary. Add the cashews. Blend until smooth.",
    "Taste for seasonings and serve immediately, or let the soup cool. Cover and refrigerate it.",
    "Note: If you’re not using a Vitamix, wait for the soup to cool before blending. You can use a hand blender directly in the pot, too."
