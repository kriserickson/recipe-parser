    "Directions",
    "Cook pasta according to package directions.",
    "Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients in a bowl, making sure to thoroughly break up tuna so itâ€™s really integrated into yogurt.",
    "Reserve about 1/2 cup cooking water before draining pasta. Transfer directly back into pot and stir in yogurt sauce. If pasta is a little dry and resistant to stirring, add pasta water a little at a time until sauce is evenly distributed. Serve pasta garnished with additional parsley, tomato, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, if desired."
