    "Puree apple and banana in a food processor. Use the whisk attachment on your electric mixer and whip almond butter on high for 2-3 minutes until smooth and fluffed. Add puree and remaining ingredients to whipped almond butter and continue to whip until combined. Grease your hot waffle maker (for each waffle you make) with olive oil or coconut oil spray. Use about 1 ladle of batter per 8x4-inch waffle onto hot waffle iron for 3-5 minutes until browned. Do not fill up entire waffle maker, leave about 40% unfilled so that the batter can spread. If your waffle is soft or floppy, it’s not ready yet – keep cooking for another minute or two! Eat immediately or store flat in freezer and make your own breakfast by reheating in toaster – the waffles will be firm enough! Top with pure maple syrup or make a blueberry syrup (cover 2 cups of frozen blueberries with water in a pot, boil, and mash)."
