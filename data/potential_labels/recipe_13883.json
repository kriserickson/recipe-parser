    "Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C), and prepare a muffin pan by coating the cups with cooking spray or greasing them with oil. Set aside.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the oats, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.",
    "In a separate bowl, beat the egg until it becomes slightly frothy. Whisk in the yogurt, honey, sugar, almond milk and vanilla, mixing until well-combined.",
    "Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing gently until just combined. Toss the blueberries with 1 tablespoon of flour to prevent them from bleeding or sinking to the bottom of the muffins, and fold them into the batter.",
    "Divide the batter evenly among the 12 muffin cups, filling almost to the top. Add a sprinkle of coconut sugar, if desired.",
    "Bake for 20–22 minutes, or until the tops of the muffins are firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.",
    "*You can also use a mix of all-purpose and whole-wheat flour or sub oat flour, but the texture will be slightly denser and moister.",
