    "First up, let’s get the moisture out of the zoodles, no one likes watery pasta! It’s totally up to you, and what you want to do with your zoodles, but I typically prefer the salting method. This gets the moisture out, so that they don’t become a watery mess when heated with the sauce. To do this, place your zoodles on top of paper towels or a clean dishtowel and salt them generously. Set aside for at least 20 minutes, while they release their moisture.",
    "Add all of the sauce ingredients to a food processor (or blender) and pulse until well combined. Set aside.",
    "Heat the coconut oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once the oil has melted, add the chicken to the pan. Sauté until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.",
    "Let’s get back to the zoodles! Press the salted zoodles between dry paper towels or another clean dishrag, to remove the excess moisture.",
    "Turn down the heat of the pan to medium-low, and add the zoodles to the pan. Stir well. Once the zoodles are warm, turn the heat off and add the sun dried tomato sauce, and pine nuts to the pan and stir until combined. Enjoy!"
