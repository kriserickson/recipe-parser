    "TO MAKE MEATBALLS: In a large bowl, combine turkey meat, egg, flour, garlic, salt, and herbs and mix until well incorporated. Roll into small balls (about 1 1/2 inches). You’ll get about 24-26 meatballs. Heat 2 tbsp fat of choice in a large skillet on medium-high heat. Cook meatballs for 3-4 minutes, until all sides are brown. You may need to do this in batches. Set aside.",
    "TO MAKE SOUP: Heat 2 tbsp fat of choice in large soup pot. Add onions, carrots and garlic and cook until onions are translucent – about 5 minutes.",
    "Add bay leaves, broth, and meatballs. Bring to a boil, turn down heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.",
    "Add kale and cook until meatballs are cooked through- about 5-7 minutes.",
    "Serve immediately. Garnish with fresh herbs and red pepper flakes."
