    "Recipe Directions",
    "1. Wash and dry your mushrooms. Chop 'em up a bit.",
    "2. Add all ingredients (except the second amount of reserved finely chopped mushrooms) into your high-speed blender. Blend on high until very smooth and well-blended. Blend for an abnormally long time because you want this raw cream of mushroom recipe to be slightly warm when coming out of the blender.",
    "3. Pour liquidy mushroom soup mixture into a bowl(s). Add remaining mushrooms and stir with a spoon. See what we're doing here? We're making a liquidy mixture and then adding some chunks to it to give it some texture and variety. That's the trick to all my raw soups.",
    "4. Eat this raw cream of mushroom soup recipe immediately, while still warm from the blender!"
