    "Remove the crabsticks from their individual plastic sheaths, and unroll them and peel them into strips of about 1cm. This is the most time consuming part.",
    "Then, toss them in 1-2 tablespoons of cooking oil. This is to help them crisp up better.",
    "Preheat the airfryer at 160 deg C for 3 minutes. Then place the strips in the airfryer (I did it in 2 batches for 1 packet of crabsticks) for 12 minutes. I will usually take them out to toss every 4 minutes to make sure they don't stick together."
