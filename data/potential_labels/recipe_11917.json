    "1. Add all of the raw cream of celery soup recipe ingredients (except the last 1/2 cup of celery) to your high-speed blender.",
    "2. Blend in your high-speed blender. Start blending on low and work your way all the way up to high. Blend for a very long time so that the stringiness is blended and so that the soup recipe warms up nicely from the speed of your blender.",
    "3. Place your 1/2 cup chopped celery into a bowl. Pour blended celery soup mixture on top of the chopped celery. Mix gently with a spoon.",
    "4. Serve immediately. For an added touch, garnish with thinly sliced avocado."
