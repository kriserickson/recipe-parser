    "For coffee rub: Mix all ingredients in small\nbowl. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead.\nStore airtight at room temperature.",
    "For burgers: Cook bacon in large skillet\nuntil crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain.\nBreak in half. Gently mix chuck and sirloin\nin large bowl. Form meat into 8 patties, each\n3 1/2 to 4 inches in diameter and 1/3 to 1/2 inch\nthick. Using thumb, make slight indentation\nin center of each burger. DO AHEAD: Burgers\nand bacon can be prepared 8 hours ahead.\nCover separately and chill.",
    "Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).\nSprinkle 1 teaspoon coffee rub on top side\nof each burger. Place burgers, rub side down,\non grill rack. Grill until slightly charred,\nabout 4 minutes; turn.",
    "Place 2 bacon slice\nhalves atop each burger. Cook 3 minutes.",
    "Top each with 1 cheese slice. Cover and cook\nuntil cheese melts, about 1 minute longer.\nPlace burgers atop bottom halves of\nbuns. Top with onion slices and tomato\nslices. Spoon dollop of Texas Barbecue\nSauce over. Cover with bun tops and serve,\npassing additional sauce alongside.",
    "What to drink: Beer is a natural pairing\nfor a burger. Keep the southern theme\ngoing by pouring a Texas brew. We like\nthe caramel sweetness and mild hoppy\nflavor of Shiner Bock ($8 per six-pack).",
    "Test-kitchen tip: Making a small\nindentation in the center of the patty before\ncooking ensures a nice, flat burger."
