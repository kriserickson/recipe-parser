    "Using a mandoline or a very sharp knife, slice potatoes so that they are as thin as possible--think McDonald's style french fries!",
    "Toss potatoes in olive oil, salt and pepper, and then spread on baking sheets. You can cook up to four baking sheets at a time so don't be afraid to leave some space on sheets so fries don't become overcrowded.",
    "Cook chili while fries are in oven by heating olive oil, adding meat and veggies, adding spices, then tomatoes and water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20 min.",
    "Chili and fries should be finished at the same time. Change oven settings from bake to broil.",
    "Plate fries by stacking them on top of each other on oven-safe plates. Ladle chili overtop, then sprinkle cheese and place in oven for about 2-3 min until cheese is melted.",
    "Finish with your favourite toppings, and serve right away while the cheese is melted and hot!"
