    "Add coconut milk (and vinegar if you like) to dry ingredients and stir to combine. Add a tablespoon or two of additional liquid at a time, until dough comes together easily. Cover and let sit at room temp for at least one hour.",
    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Use a #10 disher to scoop dough onto a parchment lined pan. Four or five individual sized crusts will bake comfortably on one half-sheet pan. Press dough into a circle, building up edge slightly. Use oiled hands to press dough out if you like. Bake for 11-12 minutes.",
    "Remove crusts from oven, top with sauce, etc. and return to oven. Heat until toppings are bubbly, about 8-10 minutes. Parbaked crusts can be stored frozen to use as needed."
