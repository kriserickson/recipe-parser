    "In a large bowl, beat the butter and brown sugar until fluffy. Add the molasses, ginger and egg; mix well. Sift in the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt. Press dough into a thick, flat disk and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate at least 4 hours.",
    "Heat oven to 350ÂºF and line a cookie sheet with parchment or a silicon baking mat. Shape the dough into 1-inch balls and arrange on your prepared baking sheet. Use your thumb to make a small indentation in each ball; place a caramel candy into each indentation. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Bake 8-10 minutes, or until the edges begin to brown and the cookies look soft but set. Transfer to a rack and let cool."
