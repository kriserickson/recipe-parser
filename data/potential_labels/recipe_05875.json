    "In large pot, sauté onions, celery, peppers, and garnet yams in olive oil, lightly seasoned with salt and freshly ground black pepper, until onions soften and start to turn golden. Stir in garlic, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, and cayenne and cook for 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes, chickpeas, stock or water, salt, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, cover, turn heat down to low, and simmer for 20-30 minutes until flavors have blended. Taste and add salt, freshly ground black pepper, or cayenne, as needed. Stir in fresh parsley and serve.",
