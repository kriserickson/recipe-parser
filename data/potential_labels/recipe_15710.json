    "Preheat oven to 350°F. Wash and cut the stalks of celery into halves. Peel as many of the strings off as you can.",
    "In a food processor blend the macadamia nuts, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, water, and fresh basil. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Lay the celery in an oven proof dish. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Spoon the macadamia nut cheese into the celery. Divide it up as evenly as you can.",
    "Bake for around 40 minutes. If you'd like the macadamia cheese to look more brown then pop it under the broiler for a few minutes. It's ready when the celery is soft and can be easily cut with a fork."
