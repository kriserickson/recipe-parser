    "Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat and add chopped onions, saute until soft for 5 minutes or so. Next add the chopped garlic, stirring for a couple of minutes (don’t let it burn).",
    "Add peas, minced or finely chopped lemongrass, and water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, you can lower the heat to low, add the curry while it simmers for 10-15 minutes, covered.",
    "Turn the heat off and add the coconut milk, with either an emulsion blender or pouring it into a blender, blend the soup until smooth. If it’s too thick, you can just add water to thin it out or if you want it thicker… add more coconut milk! Serve."
