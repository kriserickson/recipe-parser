    "Preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) or 180C/350F (fan / convection).",
    "Place mushrooms cap side down in a medium baking dish (so they are kind of snug - they shrink).",
    "Mix butter and garlic in a small bowl.",
    "Spoon 1 tsp of butter over each mushroom, then use the rest to brush the edges (or carefully drizzle over edges).",
    "Drizzle over olive oil, sprinkle (generously) with salt and pepper.",
    "Roast for 20 minutes (tender but still a slight firmness) or 25 minutes (tender). There should be some juices in the pan and plenty pooled in the mushrooms caps.",
    "Squeeze over a bit of lemon juice if using, garnish with thyme and parsley. Serve mushrooms, drizzled with pan juices (see notes for serving suggestions)."
