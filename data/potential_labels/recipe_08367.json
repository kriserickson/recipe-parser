    "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line an 8.5 x 4.5* loaf pan with parchment paper (I recommend this over greasing the pan since it's a lot less messy this way!)",
    "In a large bowl, mash the bananas well and whisk with the eggs, coconut milk, vanilla, and maple syrup.",
    "In a smaller bowl, combine the coconut flour, tapioca, baking soda and powder, and salt.",
    "Slowly stir the dry ingredients into the wet until fully combined. Coconut flour expands quite a bit and the batter will be thick.",
    "Finally, fold in the blueberries. Transfer the entire mixture into the parchment lined loaf pan and spread it out evenly.",
    "Bake in the preheated oven for 55-60 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.",
    "Remove from oven and allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes until transferring to a wire rack** to cool completely. Wait about an hour before slicing.",
    "Enjoy!"
