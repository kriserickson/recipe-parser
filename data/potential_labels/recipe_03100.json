    "In a medium pot over medium heat, sauté 2/3 cup of the onion and garlic in the oil for about 3-5 minutes, until it starts to get soft. Add the ground beef, cinnamon, cumin, cloves, and cayenne, crumbling the beef as it cooks.",
    "Once the beef is cooked and no longer pink, add the water, beer, tomato sauce, and tomato paste and mix together. Add the chocolate and vinegar, then simmer the mixture uncovered over medium-low heat for about 15-20 minutes, until it has thickened but is still soupy.",
    "While the chili is simmering, cook the spaghetti in a pot of boiling water, about 8 minutes, or until al dente, then drain.",
    "When ready to serve, divide the pasta into bowls, cover with a heaping spoonful of chili, then top with shredded Cheddar cheese and a sprinkling of the remaining raw, chopped onions."
