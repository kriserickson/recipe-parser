    "Warm the oil in a large stockpot over a medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté for a minute. Add the bell peppers and carrot and cook for a minute more. Add the broccoli and cook for another 3 minutes. You want to get the vegetables to soften up just a little but they’re gonna cook through the whole soup making processes, so don’t go trying to make those crispy bitches all soggy right out the gate. Gross.",
    "Add the garlic, ginger, curry powder, and soy sauce and cook for 30 more seconds or until your place starts smelling fucking amazing. Throw in the coconut milk and vegetable broth and bring that shit to a simmer, stirring it every now and then, about 5 minutes. Add the cooked noodles and spinach and let it all simmer together until the spinach starts to wilt, about a minute more. Turn off the heat and stir in the cilantro, lime juice, and Sriracha and taste. Add more curry powder, lime juice, garlic, soy sauce, whatever you think it needs to start tasting right.",
    "Serve right away topped with some extra cilantro or some green onions, maybe some sliced peppers and lime wedges on the side. Whatever the fuck you’re feeling.",
    "*Just keep this bite-sized. Trying to cut something up once it’s in a soup will lead to a goddamn mess.",
    "** Make sure you don’t grab one that has salt as an ingredient. You’re a fucking grownup and can add salt on your own, thankyouverymuch.",
    "*** You could use udon instead or hell, you could even use spaghetti if that’s what you’ve got. No need to go to extra stores just for this bullshit.",
    "*** If the curry powder you’re using is hot or you know you can’t hang, just leave this shit out."
