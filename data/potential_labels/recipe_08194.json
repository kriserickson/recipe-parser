    "In a frying pan, saute ground beef and onion in olive oil. Add the Italian seasoning, garlic salt and pepper and cook until the liquid cooks down. Mix in tomato sauce and set aside.",
    "In a 9.5 x 9.5 in. baking dish lined with parchment paper, create a base eggplant layer with 1/3 of the eggplant. Add 1/3 of the meat , then 1/3 of the ricotta, sprinkle with black pepper, then 1/3 of the cheese. Repeat 3 times, topping with a layer of mozzarella cheese.",
    "Bake for 1 hour.",
    "Saute the onions in the butter or oil for 5 minutes until translucent, stir in the frozen artichokes and saute over medium heat until lightly golden brown and cooked through. Add all the spices (salt, pepper, garlic powder and parsley and then stir in spinach. Once fully cooked the cream cheese can be stirred in. (Its totally optional and gives it more of a spinach artichoke dip kind of vibe- but the lasagna is delicious with or without it!) If you really want it to taste like spinach artichoke dip you can throw the mixture with the cream cheese into a food processor. But again- this is option. Its good either way.",
