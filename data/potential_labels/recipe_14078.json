    "To make the chia pudding, combine all of the chia pudding ingredients and mix well. Let it sit covered in your fridge for at least 30 minutes. I recommend refrigerating them overnight so you can eat for breakfast the next day.",
    "To make the chai cream, blend all the ingredients and store in a squeeze bottle if you want to be fancy, or in a container to keep it simple.",
    "When ready to serve, top your bowl of chia pudding with a tablespoon of chai cream and fresh berries of your choosing."

    "Chia Pudding Ingredients:",
    "1 cup coconut milk (I use organic coconut milk powder with water to avoid the chemicals in store-bought milks)",
    "¼ cup chia seeds (whole)",
    "1 tbsp Lakanto maple syrup (this makes it sugar-free, as it is made of monkfruit which your body does not recognize as sugar. I highly recommend buying this for ALL of your recipes – you’ll never look back!)",
    "½ tsp vanilla extract",
    "½ tsp cinnamon",
    "Chai Cream Ingredients:",
