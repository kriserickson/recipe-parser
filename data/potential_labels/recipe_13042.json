    "Instructions",
    "Preheat oven to 200C / 390F (fan forced / convection) or 220C / 430F (standard oven).",
    "Toss potatoes in oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Scatter on baking tray.",
    "Place in oven for 15 minutes (giving them a head start).",
    "Pork",
    "Meanwhile, mix the Rub ingredients together in a small bowl.",
    "Slather the pork on both sides with the Rub, reserving some Rub for basting. (See notes for marinating)",
    "Take the tray out of the oven. Place pork on the tray.",
    "Bake for 10 minutes. Remove tray from oven, spoon over reserved rub on the surface then bake for a further 10 minutes (or 15 minutes for large chops ~ 350g/12oz) (Note 4).",
    "Take tray out of the oven, flick to grill/broiler on high.",
    "Use a brush to get the golden juices off the tray (especially around pork) and dab it onto the pork - this is key for flavour and colour!",
    "Pop pork under grill/broiler for a few minutes until pork is caramelised and golden.",
    "Serve, scraping the juices on the tray onto the pork, then garnish with parsley if desired."
