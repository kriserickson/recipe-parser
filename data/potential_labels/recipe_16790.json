    "Quarter one lemon. Fill the cavity of the chicken with the lemon quarters, oregano sprigs (if using), and 4 of the garlic cloves.",
    "Puree the remaining 2 garlic cloves, the zest and juice of the remaining lemon, 2 tablespoons oregano, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a food processor. Rub the mixture all over the chicken, getting under the skin as much as possible.",
    "Place the chicken in a roasting pan and let it come to room temperature.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Roast the chicken in the preheated oven until done (about 1 1/2 to 2 hours). It is done when the juices run clear when you slice just behind the drumstick or when a meat thermometer reads 170°F. Remove from oven and let rest for 20 minutes."
