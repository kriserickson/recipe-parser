    "Remove from heat; stir in hot sauce and butter (mixture will bubble vigorously). Return to a boil and cook another 3 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in salt, baking soda, and cayenne. Working quickly (and carefully—caramel will be very hot), pour caramel mixture over popcorn and toss to coat.",
    "Spread out popcorn on prepared baking sheet and bake, tossing once, until dry, 15–20 minutes. Let cool.",
    "Do Ahead: Popcorn can be made 4 hours ahead. Store airtight at room temperature to keep out moisture."
