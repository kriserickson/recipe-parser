    "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Sift together in a large bowl the unbleached flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir in the whole-wheat flour and wheat germ. Cut in shortening. Stir in the milk with a fork just until dough cleans the sides of the bowl. Knead lightly on a floured surface. Pat or roll out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into squares with a knife and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F. for 12 to 15 minutes. Serve with sweet butter and strawberry preserves. Makes 12 to 16 biscuits."
