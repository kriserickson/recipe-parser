    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large roasting pan or baking sheet with sides with parchment or grease well.",
    "Pound out the chicken breasts between two pieces of saran wrap with a meat mallet until they are a thin, even thickness, about 1/4-inch thick. If they are very large cut them in half. Season well on both sides with salt and pepper.",
    "Set up a dredging station with the mayonnaise in a shallow bowl and the tortilla crumbs in another.",
    "Working one at a time coat each chicken breast lightly with mayonnaise, then tortilla crumbs, patting them on with your hands if needed.",
    "Bake about 20 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked to an internal temperature of 165 - 170 degrees F.",
    "Remove the pan from oven and top each piece of chicken with 1/3 cup salsa topped with 1/3 cup cheese. Put the pan back in the oven about 5 minutes until cheese is melted, alternately you can turn on the broiler and broil them about 1 minute until cheese is melted with some golden spots."
