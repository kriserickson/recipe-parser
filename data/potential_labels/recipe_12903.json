    "Ahead of time, mix sage into soft butter. Press into a mold or small, straight glass jar and set in fridge to chill.",
    "Set steak on counter and to come to room temperature.",
    "Prepare a hot grill. Allow coals to get hot enough that you can't hold you hand four inches above them for more than a few seconds. Bank coals to one side of the grill to create a zone of high heat and a zone of indirect heat.",
    "Just before grilling, sprinkle merlot steak on both sides with sea salt and pepper; lightly press seasoning into surface. Set steak over hot coals, grill 2 - 3 minutes, flip, and grill 2 - 3 minutes longer. More steak over indirect heat until internal temperature reaches 130 degrees F for rare or 140 degrees F for medium-rare (steaks pictured are medium-rare). Rest 5 minutes.",
    "With a very sharp chef's knife, slice steaks into thin (1/4-inch thick) slices, dot with butter, and serve immediately."
