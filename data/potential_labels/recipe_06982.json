    "To prepare this Greek brizola recipe with roast potatoes (Greek pork chops), start by preparing the marinade. In a large bowl add the roughly chopped onions, the garlic slices and the pork chops (brizola). Drizzle with olive oil and red wine vinegar and season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Sprinkle the pork chops with oregano and blend to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, chill and let marinade for 1-2 hours.",
    "Cut a large piece of parchment paper and soak it with water. Squeeze to get rid of the excessive water and line on a large baking tray. Place the potatoes on the parchment paper, drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice, pour in the white wine and season with salt. Sprinkle the potatoes with oregano and minced garlic. Cover with a large wet piece of parchment paper and join the edges together to seal. Bake at 180C for about 45 minutes.",
    "Now it’s time to get some colour on the pork chops. Heat a griddle pan over high heat and sear the pork chops for about 1 minute on each side, until nicely coloured.",
    "Turn the baking tray out of the oven. Uncover the parchment paper and place the pork chops over the potatoes on a single layer. Cover again to seal and pop back in the oven for about 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the pork chops.",
    "Remove the baking tray from the oven, unwrap and remove the pork chops. Cover the pork chops with aluminium foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Bake the potatoes uncovered for about 15 minutes, until nicely coloured.",
    "Serve while still warm. Enjoy!"
