    "Heat a large skillet over medium-heat. Split and toast the brioche buns until nice and golden, about 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "Divide the ground chuck into 4 equal portions and shape into burger patties, slightly larger than the width of the brioche buns. Place a thumbprint in the center of each patty to help stop the burgers from shrinking. Season both sides of each patty with salt and pepper.",
    "Melt the butter in the skillet and fry the burgers, about 4 minutes per side, for medium-cooked burgers (cook longer if you prefer your burgers well done). In the last minute of cooking top each patty with 2 slices of cheese.",
    "Build the burgers with 1 tablespoon of sauce, 1 burger, 2 slices of bacon, 1/4 cup of kimchi, and a lettuce leaf."
