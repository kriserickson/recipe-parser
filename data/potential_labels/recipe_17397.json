    "In a medium bowl, cream together butter and cream cheese. Add the egg, almond extract and orange extract and mix until combined. Add the white cake mix and mix until combined. Stir in ¼ cup of sprinkles. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to 24 hours. The longer the dough chills, the less sticky it will be.",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place powdered sugar in one bowl and the remaining ¼ cup of sprinkles in another bowl. Using a 1-inch cookie scoop, scoop out dough and roll into a ball. Sprinkle with a few extra sprinkles and roll in powdered sugar, completely covering the dough ball. Place on a greased cookie sheet. Repeat. Bake for 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on cookie sheet for two minutes before removing to wire rack. Makes around 42 small cookies."
