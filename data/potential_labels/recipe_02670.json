    "If using bamboo skewers, soak them in water at least 30 minute before starting. If using metal skewers, skip this step.",
    "Preheat grill to medium heat, about 350 to 450 degrees F.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the lime zest, 1/4 teaspoon of cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Place the chicken pieces into the bowl and toss to combine until evenly coated with the seasonings. Thread the chicken and onion onto skewers.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons lime juice, 1 teaspoon hot sauce, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon cumin. Stir in water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the mixture reaches a consistency where it can be drizzled.",
    "In another bowl, toss together the salsa ingredients and season with salt to taste.",
    "Brush the skewers with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill directly over the heat, covered, for about 8 minutes, turning occasionally. Remove from the grill and let rest for 3 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grill the tortillas for 1 to 2 minutes to warm, turning once. Slide the chicken and onions off the skewers onto a large platter, and let everyone assemble their own tacos with the mayo and salsa.",
