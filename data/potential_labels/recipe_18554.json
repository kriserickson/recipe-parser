    "Bake the biscuits according to the biscuit recipe. Allow to cool completely.",
    "Using a hand mixer, whip the two packages of vanilla pudding mix and 2 cups cold milk until pudding is thickened. About 3-5 minutes.",
    "Fold in almost the entire tub of cool whip. Reserve some for garnish/decoration on top of the trifle.",
    "Split the biscuits in half with your hand. Reserve 3 top halves of the biscuits for the top layer. Layer other biscuits on the bottom of the trifle bowl, then about 1/3 of the sliced strawberries, and half of the vanilla pudding and cool whip mix. Repeat with the biscuits, 1/3 strawberries, and other half of the pudding mix. Place the 3 reserved biscuits on top of the pudding mix layer. Garnish top with the rest of the strawberries and leftover cool whip as desired. Serve immediately or plastic wrap the top and refrigerate."
