    "Rinse the rice and cook in 2 cups water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat, covered, until tender, 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep covered 10 minutes more.",
    "Meanwhile, toss the cabbage with the salt and set aside in a colander to drain. (It should be sliced as thinly as possible, so it wilts in the salt.)",
    "Toss the shrimp with the chile-garlic sauce and brown sugar to coat. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook until just cooked through and slightly smoky, 4 to 5 minutes, adding the sesame seeds in the last minute of cooking. Season the shrimp with a pinch of salt.",
    "Divide the rice between 4 bowls. Top with the shrimp, cabbage, green onion, kimchi and any other vegetables."
