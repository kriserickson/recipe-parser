    "Step 1 - Tear up the fig leaves and add them to a blender and blend the cream until you get small pieces of fig leaf. Heat in a small saucepan until simmering and then remove from heat. Allow to steep for 30 minutes.",
    "Step 2 - Heat up the cream again to a gentle boiling point. While it is heating, whisk the eggs and sugar together until syrupy. When the cream has reached simmering point, whisk in the egg mixture and stir well. Remove from heat and keep stirring until the sugar has dissolved.",
    "Step 3 - Add in the honey and taste - I usually add a tablespoon first because the fig leaf can be delicate and I just want a little honey flavour. Strain into a container and place cling wrap directly on the surface of the custard and allow to cool completely. Place in freezer until set. If it is set hard, you may need to ripen it by taking it out of the freezer 5 minutes before scooping. Serve with fresh figs."
