    "Pound the allspice berries, peppercorns and chilli flakes in a pestle and mortar until fine, then mix in the sugar and honey. Finely chop the herbs, chillies, garlic and ginger, add to the spice mixture and bash it all up some more. Add the green parts of the spring onions and a good drizzle of oil and mix well. Pour the marinade over the chicken and massage it in – wear rubber gloves if you want as those chillies are hot! Leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 1 to 2 hours, but preferably overnight.",
    "Place the chicken, skin-side down, on the barbecue over a medium heat and cook for 40 to 50 minutes, turning often, or until the chicken is golden and cooked through. It’s nice to add a handful of allspice berries to the coals for some extra flavour in the smoke or to drizzle over a little beer near the end of cooking for extra stickiness. You could also cook them in the oven at 200°C/400°F/gas 6 for 25 to 30 minutes, turning occasionally, then finish them off on the barbecue for 5 minutes to get all lovely and charred."
