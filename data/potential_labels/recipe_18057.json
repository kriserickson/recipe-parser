    "Lay the patties out so that they cover the bottom. In between the first and second layer, cover with mushrooms and then dump the rest on top. If you do not like or have issues with mushrooms, you can leave them out. We love them so we pile them on for that extra bit of rich flavoring.",
    "Now if you prepped ahead this meal, then just re-shake the broth mixture. Then pour over the meat patties and mushrooms.",
    "Cover and cook for 6-8 hours on Low Heat setting.",
    "Since the patties are not “grilled” and have been cooking in their own gravy, the meat will be pink inside which is normal. They will be done. Check with a meat thermometer to be sure to satisfy your own fears."
