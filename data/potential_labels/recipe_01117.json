    "Meanwhile, thinly slice your red onion. Blanch the slices in boiling water for 30 seconds and chill them immediately in ice water. Drain and toss them with the rice vinegar and salt. Refrigerate until ready to use. (longer the better, you can also make them ahead and store in the fridge for at least a few days)",
    "Remove fish from the fridge. Heat a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat and cook the fish 3-4 minutes per side, or until it’s done and flaky. Squeeze a few big squeezes of lime juice on it just before you take it out of your pan. Let fish cool slightly, and flake it into smaller pieces.",
