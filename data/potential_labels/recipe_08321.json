    "Heat the oven to 350°. In a large saucepan, heat the cream with the butter and bay leaves over medium-high. Stir in the garlic, carrots, potatoes, onion, and celery root and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer and cook, stirring gently, until tender but not breaking, about 18 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the thyme, and scrape into a 3-qt. round baking dish. Season the gratin with salt and pepper.",
    "Using a box grater, grate the Gruyère into a medium bowl and then toss with the bread crumbs. Sprinkle the cheese and bread crumbs over the vegetables and bake until the topping is golden brown and the gratin is bubbling in the center, about 30 minutes."
