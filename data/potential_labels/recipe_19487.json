    "Set the Instant Pot to sauté. Melt ghee, then working in batches, sauté the meat for 2-3 minutes, turning every minute so all sides are browned. Transfer meat to a plate and set aside.",
    "Add onion and sauté, scraping up the brown bits. Sprinkle salt over onion and allow to caramelize. If mixture becomes too dry, add splashes of the beef broth. Once fully caramelized, cancel sauté.",
    "Add the rest of the ingredients to the pot. Cover and lock lid into place. Select meat/stew function, or set the IP to pressure cook on high for 35 minutes.",
    "Once fully cooked, allow for a natural pressure release (about 30 minutes).",
    "If it’s too soupy, scoop out a little broth. Whisk in the thickener of your choice until no clumps remain. Then stir it into the soup. If it’s still not thick enough, repeat until the desired texture is reached. Season with more garlic salt to taste.",
