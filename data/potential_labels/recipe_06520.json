    "Blend on high for 5 minutes, or until the coconut begins to come together as a paste. You may need to stop the blender every minute or so to scrape down the sides of the bowl to get all of the dry flakes milled into the butter.",
    "When it's done it will be a creamy dough.",
    "To serve, spread on toast or over fruit, mix into oatmeal or eat it straight up!",
    "To store: scoop the coconut butter out into a glass jar and store at room temperature."
