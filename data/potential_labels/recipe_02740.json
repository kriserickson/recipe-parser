    "Instructions from The Armenian Kitchen say to form the dough into walnut-sized pieces with slightly dampened hands. My dough was too runny to be handled. The recipe has no flour, so what do you do? I just spooned out dough onto the ungreased cookie sheet and hoped for the best. With about an inch and a half between the cookie batter plops, there was ample room for spreading, which they did. All was well, so just don’t sweat this part.",

    "Sprinkle the tops with sesame seeds. This is optional, of course. I opted for a good dosing of seeds. Why not? They are good for you!",
    "Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes. The cookies will be golden when cooked. The centers will still be soft.",
    "Allow the cookies to cool for several minutes on the cookie sheet before handling. They are very fragile until cooled."
