    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place a skillet over medium heat, add the oil if using. Most Mexican chorizos have enough fat and won’t need the vegetable oil. Add the chorizo and cook, stir frequently to cook evenly and avoid it from sticking to the bottom. It’ll take about 6-7 minutes to cook.",
    "Once cooked, remove the excess fat from the skillet or place the cooked chorizo over a paper towel to absorb the fat.",
    "Place the chorizo in an oven proof dish, setting aside 2 tablespoons to garnish when ready to serve. I divided the chorizo and cheese into 2 small clay pots, but you can use a large oven proof dish.",
    "Place the grated cheese over the chorizo and bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbling. Do not overcook or it will have a chewy texture.",
    "Remove form oven and place over a heat proof surface. Serve warm with salsa and plenty of flour tortillas or tortilla chips."
