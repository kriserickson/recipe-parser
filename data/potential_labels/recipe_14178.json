    "The night before, mix the oats and chia seeds together in a container with a cover. Add water and mix completely, so the chia seeds are not stuck together. Soak overnight in the fridge.",
    "The morning of, rinse and prep the produce. To draw out the sweetness of the apple, we recommend shredding the apple with a food processor or grater. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze out the juice by hand, making sure to discard the seeds.",
    "Mix the fruit in with the chia and oat mixture. Slowly add the lemon, tasting as you go to make sure you don’t add too much. Everyone’s fresh lemon tolerance is different.",
    "Add extras, such as sweet maple syrup or crunchy unsalted nuts if desired. If you have a zester, freshly zested lemon peel is a tasty addition to this dish."
