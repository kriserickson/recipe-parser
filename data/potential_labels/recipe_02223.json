    "Preheat the oven to 350º. Grease a shallow, 9-by-13-inch baking dish.",
    "In the dish, arrange the potato slices in layers, sprinkling each layer with onion, cheese, salt and pepper. Finish with a thick layer of cheese and dot the top with the remaining butter.",
    "Beat the egg and milk together. Pour this mixture carefully over the potatoes. Cover the dish with buttered foil.",
    "Bake in the center of the oven until the potatoes are tender and the topping is golden, 1½ hours. If you'd like the top to be more browned and crisp, remove the foil 15 to 20 minutes before you finishing baking. Serve warm."
