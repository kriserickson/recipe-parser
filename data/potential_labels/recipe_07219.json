    "In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and pepper. Make a well in the center, and add eggs and 1/4 of the milk. Using a whisk, combine eggs and milk, then incorporate flour; begin with the inner rim of the well. Continue whisking until a smooth, stiff batter forms. Stir in half of the remaining milk. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
    "Heat oven to 400 degrees. Place 12 3/4-cup capacity muffin tins in oven until very hot, about 5 minutes.",
    "Stir enough of the remaining milk into the batter until it is the consistency of heavy cream. Transfer 1 to 2 teaspoons of drippings into each muffin tin. Pour batter in the muffin tins, filling them about one-third full; the batter should sizzle in the hot drippings. Return to oven and bake until puffed, browned, and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. Yorkshire pudding is best served fresh from the oven, but it can be kept warm in a low oven for about 15 minutes."
