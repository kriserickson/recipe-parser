    "Place the lamb into a bowl with 10g of the tikka curry spice and mix well until evenly coated.",
    "In a casserole dish add 1 tablespoon of the sunflower oil and gently cook the onions over a medium-low heat until they soften. Add the garlic, chilli, ginger and remaining tikka curry spice, reduce the heat, and continue cooking for about 5 minutes.",
    "Add the chopped tomatoes, lentils, water and season with a pinch of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a simmer.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and cook the lamb until sealed all over. Transfer to the casserole pot and give everything a good stir, then cover with a lid and leave to simmer, stirring occasionally, for 2–2 ½ hours on a low heat.",
    "Once the lamb is cooked through and really tender, taste the sauce and adjust seasoning if required. Stir through the fresh coriander and serve immediately."
