    "The night before, dissolve the yeast into the water for the Poolish, then mix in the all-purpose flour. Cover and let it ferment at room temperature for 12-16 hours, or overnight. Once the Poolish has bubbles breaking on top and has started to wrinkle, it's ready.",
    "Transfer the Poolish into the bowl of a stand mixer attached with a dough hook. Add water, salt, yeast and all-purpose flour and knead the dough on slow speed for 2-3 minutes. Cover and let it rise for two hours, giving it a stretch-and-fold at the one hour mark.",
    "Divide the dough into three equal pieces. Cover and let rest for about 20 minutes. Shape into baguettes about 12 inches logs and cover, letting them rise for about 60 to 90 minutes.",
    "Score and bake on a preheated oven at 450F. Place a tray of water below the baguette while baking to create steam in the oven. Bake for about 25 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool and serve."
