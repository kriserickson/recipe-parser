    "Heat the blackberries in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer 6-7 minutes until the berries start to soften and break down. Mash the berries lightly with a potato masher or fork, leaving some chunks. Stir in the lemon juice, maple syrup and chia seeds and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often. Turn the heat off and let the mixture cool. As it cools, the jam will thicken. Store jam in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks."
