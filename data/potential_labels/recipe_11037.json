    "Season the chicken with salt and pepper, to taste.",
    "Heat oil in a dutch oven over high heat. Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until brown on all sides, about 6 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.",
    "Add carrots and onion to the dutch oven and cook, stirring often, until onions begin to soften, about 4-5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, stirring nonstop. Add ½ cup chicken stock while stirring and scraping to loosen browned bits from the bottom of the dutch oven.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together flour and ½ cup broth; add to the dutch oven. Stir in chicken and remaining 4 cups of chicken broth. Add bay leaf and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 25 minutes, partially covered.",
    "Add potatoes and cook uncovered until potatoes are tender, about 18-20 minutes. The liquid will slightly reduce even further. Stir in parsley and discard bay leaf before serving."
