    "Whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Place Meyer lemon zest and white sugar in a food processor and pulse for 1 minute. Beat butter and cream cheese in a large mixer bowl at medium speed until smooth; add lemon-sugar and brown sugar to cream cheese mixture and beat until creamy. Beat in egg and vanilla until combined. Reduce speed to low and gradually add flour mixture; beat just until incorporated. Fold in 1 cup white chocolate chips. Cover dough and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to overnight.",
    "Preheat oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper. Form 1 1/2″ balls of dough and place two inches apart on prepared baking sheets; flatten mounds slightly. Top cookies with remaining white chocolate chips (5 to 6 per cookie), pressing gently to adhere. Bake, rotating pans halfway through, for 8 minutes, until edges are set. Cool for 3 minutes on baking sheets, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.",
