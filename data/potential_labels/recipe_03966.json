    "Bring the potatoes to a boil in a large pot of salted water. Cook until tender and easily pierced with a knife, 20 to 25 minutes total. Drain potatoes and return to the pot.",
    "Add the mayonnaise, dry mustard powder, yellow mustard, celery, shallots, salt, and a generous amount of pepper. Smash using a potato masher until desired texture is reached. (I like small chunks of potatoes throughout.)",
    "Refrigerate until chilled. Adjust seasonings to personal preference upon serving; the flavors will have married and become a bit less pungent.",
