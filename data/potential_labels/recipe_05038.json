    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and lightly coat an 8x8 (or similar size) baking dish with coconut or olive oil.",
    "Add fruit directly to the dish as you chop it and spread flat.",
    "To a mixing bowl add crumble ingredients and, using your hands or a wooden spoon, mix until all everything is evenly distributed.",
    "Add to the top of the fruit in an even layer and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the fruit is bubbling and the top is crisp and golden.",
    "Serve as is, or with dairy-free ice cream, such as Raspberry Ripple or Cherry Pie! Best when fresh, though leftovers keep for 2-3 days covered in the refrigerator."
