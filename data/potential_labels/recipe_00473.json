    "Fold in egg whites to egg yolks mixture, 1/3 portion at a time.",
    "Sift in the plain flour and corn flour to the mixture. Then quickly add in oil.",

    "Tips on how to roll a Swiss roll:",
    "After cooling the cake for a while, and the cake is still warm, use a clean tea towel to pre-roll the cake and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Then off you go for spreading the filling and rolling the cake nicely. The pre-roll method helps stretch the cake and then can be easily rolled in a round shape. The surface of the cake wonâ€™t stick onto the tea towel.",
    "When you're ready to roll the cake, use a sharp knife to score three lines at one end, each line 0.5cm apart. And start rolling from this end.",
    "Use a baking tray a bit bigger than mine, the cake would be thinner, and easier to roll."
