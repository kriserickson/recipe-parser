    "Rinse and dry the pork shoulder, rub all over with salt and pepper.",
    "Combine the Rub ingredients then rub all over the pork.",
    "Place the pork in a slow cooker (fat cap up), top with the onion, jalape√±o, minced garlic (don't worry about spreading it) and squeeze over the juice of the oranges.",
    "Slow Cook on low for 10 hours or on high for 6 hours. (Note 2 for other cook methods)",
    "Pork should be tender enough to shred. Remove from slow cooker and let cool slightly. Then shred using two forks.",
    "Optional: Skim off the fat from the juices remaining in the slow cooker and discard.",
    "If you have a lot more than 2 cups of juice, then reduce it down to about 2 cups. The liquid will be salty, it is the seasoning for the pork. Set liquid aside - don't bother straining onion etc, it's super soft."
