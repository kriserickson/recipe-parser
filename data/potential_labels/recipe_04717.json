    "Strawberry-rhubarb mini galettes (makes 8 )",
    "Filling:",
    "5 oz. rhubarb (probably a couple stalks, though this depends a lot on their size)",
    "2 cups chopped strawberries",
    "1/4 cup cane sugar (raw is better)",
    "3 Tbs. brown sugar",
    "2 Tbs. water",
    "1/2 vanilla bean or 1 tsp. vanilla extract",
    "Chop the rhubarb stalks into small pieces. Combine the rhubarb, the chopped strawberries, the sugars and the water in a saucepan. Split the vanilla bean in half, scrape in the seeds and then add the pod (I actually used Tahitian vanilla – ha, definitely not local, oh well! – which didn’t seem to have seeds, so I just split it open and added it. That works too.).",
    "Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn down to low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until the fruits have broken down and cooked to a thick almost jammy consistency.",
    "Set aside to cool.",
    "Gallette dough and baking:",
    "1 1/4 cups all purpose flour",
    "1/2 tsp. salt",
    "1 tsp. sugar",
    "8 Tbs. cold, unsalted butter, cut into small pieces",
    "1/4 cup plain Greek-style yogurt (or sour cream)",
    "1 Tbs. white wine vinegar or lemon juice",
    "3 Tbs. ice cold water",
    "In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter or rub it in quickly with your fingers until a meal with pea sized chunks of floury butter forms. Chill this mixture in the fridge or freezer for 10 minutes.",
    "Make a well in the chilled flour mix, add the yogurt (or sour cream), vinegar, and 3 Tbs. water to the well. Using a fork, mix everything together, adding another Tbs. of water if needed, until a loose dough ball forms. Do not overmix. Gather the dough together and press it into a ball. Flatten it into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour. (No, it’s no fun to wait. I used to only give it about 20 minutes, but then I discovered how much better the whole rolling process works when you let the dough chill the full hour, and I am an official convert to the virtues of patience.",
    "Preheat your oven to 375F. Take the chilled dough and cut it into 8 equal sized pieces and roll each into a ball. On a very lightly floured surface, and using a floured rolling pin, roll out each ball into a circle about 1/4 inch thick. Work quickly to try to keep the dough from warming up too much, but, you know, don’t stress out about it.",
    "Put about 3 Tbs. of the strawberry-rhubarb filling in a mound in the center of each circle, then take the edges of each circle and use your fingers, to fold the edges over toward the center and crimp, and pinch and flute them, making the tarts look pretty and making them so they will contain the filling.",
    "Put the tarts on a baking sheet that is either lined with baking parchment or lightly greased. Bake in the oven for around 30 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Transfer immediately to a cooling rack and allow them to cool for at least 15 minutes or so before you eat them. You don’t want to burn your mouth!",
    "If desired, serve with whipped cream or some good ice cream"
