    "Bring 1 cup of the heavy cream and the butter to a simmer in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan over medium heat, reduce the heat to low and simmer gently until the mixture reduces to 2/3 cup, 12 to 15 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the remaining 1/2 cup cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper.",
    "While the cream reduces, bring 4 1/2 quarts water to a rolling boil, covered, in a large stockpot or Dutch oven. Using a ladle or heatproof measuring cup, scoop about 1/2 cup boiling water into each serving bowl set the bowls aside to warm. Add 1 tablespoon salt and the pasta to the pot of boiling water, cook the pasta until just shy of al dente.",
    "Meanwhile, return the cream mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, reduce the heat to low and add the pasta, Parmesan, nutmeg, peas and ham to the cream mixture. Cook over low heat, tossing the pasta with tongs to combine, until the cheese is melted, the sauce coats the pasta, and the pasta is just al dente, 1 to 2 minutes. Working quickly, empty the serving bowls of the water, divide the pasta among the bowls, tossing the pasta to coat well with sauce. Serve immediately"
