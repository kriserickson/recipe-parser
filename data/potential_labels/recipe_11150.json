    "To make the gratin, grease a 12-inch ovenproof nonstick fry pan with the butter. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the brussels sprouts and cook until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain, then transfer to a bowl of ice water. Drain and pat dry with paper towels.",
    "In a bowl, stir together the flour, Gruyère, Parmigiano-Reggiano, lemon zest, the 2 tsp. salt and the pepper. Stir in the cream, then the brussels sprouts and caramelized shallots. Transfer the mixture to the prepared fry pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture evenly on top. Bake until the bread crumbs are golden brown, about 35 minutes. Let the gratin rest for 15 minutes before serving. Serves 8.",
