    "Julienne your sweet potato [or use the large holes on a grater]. Heat a 9-10-inch skillet that is oven safe over medium and add your coconut oil. Once hot place the sweet potato in the pan and stir frequently until done to your liking. About 8-12 minutes.",
    "Set your oven to broil on high. Spread the sweet potato evenly around the pan and create 3 small wells for the eggs. Crack eggs one at a time and pour into each well. Let cook for about 2-3 minutes until the white just starts to solidify and turn opaque. Sprinkle with cheese and place under the broiler, watching closely, until eggs are cooked to your liking.",
    "Sprinkle with salt and pepper, hold the pan at an angle over a plate, and slide out of the pan with a large metal spatula. Serve immediately."
