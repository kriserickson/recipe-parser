    "In a large enameled cast-iron casserole, combine the black peppercorns, dried red chiles, cloves, cinnamon, coriander seeds and cumin seeds and cook over moderately high heat until fragrant and lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Transfer the spices to a spice grinder and let cool completely. Grind the spices to a powder.",
    "Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in the casserole. Add the grated coconut and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer the grated coconut to a blender. Add half of the onion, the toasted spices and 1/2 cup of water and puree.",
    "Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in the casserole. Add the remaining onion and the mustard seeds and cook over moderately high heat until the onion is browned, about 5 minutes. Add the turmeric, garam masala, mace and bay leaf and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the coconut-spice puree and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes.",
    "Add the unsweetened coconut milk and 2 cups of water and bring to a simmer, stirring well. Add the potatoes, carrots and a large pinch of salt. Cover and simmer over low heat until the potatoes are just tender, about 15 minutes.",
    "Stir in the cauliflower, green beans, red pepper, eggplants, corn, chopped tomato and tomato paste. Cover and simmer gently over low heat, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.",
    "Add the okra and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaf. Add the curry leaves and cilantro, season with salt and serve."
