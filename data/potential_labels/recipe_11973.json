    "Cover the rice with water by several inches in a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Let soak for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Drain well.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Warm the oil in a large ovenproof pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Season with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables just barely begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the kale and black and Urfa peppers and cook until the kale is tender, another 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring, until the rice is evenly coated and begins to lightly toast, about 3 minutes more.",
    "Add the chicken stock and lemon zest, raise the heat to high, and bring to a simmer. Stir with a fork once or twice, add 1 teaspoon salt, cover, and transfer to the oven. Bake until the rice is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Let stand off the heat, covered, for 20 minutes before fluffing with a fork and serving."
