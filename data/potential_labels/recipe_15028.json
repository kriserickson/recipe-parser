    "To make the lentil walnut crumble, place the walnuts in a food processor and pulse 2 to 3 times to break them down. Add the tamari, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, cumin, chili powder, and vinegar and pulse 2 to 3 times more. Add the lentils and pulse until the mixture is thoroughly incorporated and crumbly (it should resemble taco meat). As you go, add a few tablespoons of water as needed. Set the crumble aside until you’re ready to use it (to save time, make the crumble a day in advance). This recipe makes 2 cups, which will keep in an airtight container for up to a week.",
    "To make the cabbage slaw, combine the cabbage, scallions, pepper, and cilantro in a large mixing bowl. Whisk together the oil, lime juice, garlic, and agave syrup and pour it over the slaw. Mix well and add a dash of red pepper flakes if desired.",
    "To assemble the tacos, distribute the crumble filling evenly among the 8 taco shells. Top with a handful of the slaw, and serve."
