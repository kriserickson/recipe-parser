    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a shallow bowl, mix the mayonnaise with the Hidden Valley ® Salad Dressing and Seasoning Mix. In a second shallow bowl, place the breadcrumbs. Dip each chicken breast in the ranch dressing mixture, removing any excess, and then dip in breadcrumbs. Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet until chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes.",
