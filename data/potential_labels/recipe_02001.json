    "In a large, nonstick sauté pan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add enough potatoes to cover the bottom of the pan, and cook for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are softened and almost fork tender. Transfer them out of the pan and into a casserole dish. Repeat with remaining potatoes.",
    "During last batch of frying, preheat the oven to 375°F. Once all the potatoes are removed from the pan, turn up the heat to brown the butter, scraping up any starchy bits from the bottom of the pan. When the butter smells nutty and is noticeably brown, turn off the heat and drizzle 1-2 tablespoons of brown butter over the potatoes. Reserve remaining brown butter for other Thanksgiving dishes (try it in mashed potatoes, dressing, or even green beans). Sprinkle sage leaves and brown sugar on top of potatoes.",
    "Bake for about 40 minutes, or until sweet potatoes caramelize. Serve warm."
