    "Instructions",
    "Preheat oven to 375˚F.",
    "Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and set aside.",
    "Pat dry pork loin with paper towels.",
    "In a small mixing bowl combine paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper.",
    "Lightly spray pork loin with cooking spray. This will make it easier for the spice mix to stick.",
    "Take the spice mix and rub it all over the pork loin.",
    "Heat olive oil over medium heat and sear the pork loin until browned on all sides; about 3 to 5 minutes per side.",
    "Transfer pork loin to previously prepared baking sheet, fat-layer side up; set aside.",
    "In a bowl, combine garlic, honey, soy sauce, mustard and oil; whisk until well combined. If too thick, add a bit more oil or soy sauce. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the sauce to use for the vegetables.",
    "Brush remaining honey mixture over the pork loin.",
    "Roast for 25 minutes.",
    "In the meantime, toss the vegetables with a tablespoon of olive oil and the reserved honey mixture.",
    "Pull pork roast out of the oven and add the vegetables all around it in one layer. Tent a piece of foil over the pork so the top doesn't burn, but the inside continues to cook.",
    "Put back in the oven and continue to cook for 25 to 30 more minutes, or until internal temperature of the pork loin reaches 145˚F. Use an Instant Read Thermometer to check for doneness.",
    "Stir vegetables half way through cooking.",
    "Remove baking sheet from oven and loosely cover meat and veggies with foil; let rest 10 minutes.",
    "Cut the pork in slices and serve with veggies"
