    "Preheat an oven to 400F.",
    "While the oven heats, trim and peel the turnips. Tender baby turnips can be simply scrubbed instead of peeled, but even their peel will be a bit more fibrous than the tender insides. Leave baby turnips whole; cut larger turnips into large-ish bite-size pieces.",
    "Put the prepared turnips in a baking pan or on a baking sheet. Drizzle them with the olive oil. Use your hands or two large spoons to toss the turnips around a bit to coat them thoroughly with the oil. Sprinkle them with salt.",
    "Roast the turnips until they're tender and browned; start checking on them after about 30 minutes. Depending on the size and age of the turnips, it may take them up to an hour or more to get completely tender.",
    "If using black pepper, sprinkle turnips after 20 minutes in the oven and continue roasting. If using parsley or rosemary and thyme, toss the fully cooked turnips after they come out of the oven."
