    "Place chocolate chips in a shallow bowl.",
    "Heat coconut milk in a sauce pan over medium high heat to a scald.",
    "Pour the milk over the chocolate chips and gently stir together with a rubber spatula until ganache become smooth and uniform in cover.",
    "Use immediately for glaze or let cool at room temperature until moldable and spreadable.",
    "Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.",
    "In a small sauce pan, gently heat coconut milk to a scald. Basically, you are looking for a thin skin to form on top of the milk. Bubbles will be starting below the surface, but you do not want it to get to the point that they are breaking through. This will burn the chocolate.",
    "Quickly removed the milk from the heat and pour evenly over the chocolate chips.",
    "With a rubber spatula, gently stir together the ganache in a folding motion, from top to bottom. This will take about 2-3 minutes. At first it will look lumpy but keep up with the gentle folding. Eventually it will come together. Once this happens the ganache will get dark brown and very smooth. Be careful not to over mix. The least amount of agitation to the chocolate, the better."
