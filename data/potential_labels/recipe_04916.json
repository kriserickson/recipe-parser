    "Begin by chopping the raw bacon finely with a sharp knife. I slice it in half, then in strips, then dice it. The key is to make it small. I do not recommend a food processor because it heats the bacon up too much and can become gummy.",
    "Gently mix all ingredients in a large bowl and add the bacon. Form into 6-8 patties and put in the freezer for 30 minutes before grilling. This is not a necessary step, but I think the meat holds together nicely when the patties go on cold.",
    "Grill patties approximately 5 minutes on each side. Allow them to rest 5 minutes before serving.",

    "Cool on wire racks for 1 hour.",

    "Garnish with whipped topping, lime, and mint if desired."
