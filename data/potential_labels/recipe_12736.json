    "Preheat oven to 250°F. Mix prepared cornbread batter with corn, cheese, peppers and onion. Drop by tablespoonful into hot oil and fry until golden brown on all sides. Drain on paper towels and hold in oven while fondue is prepared",
    "Dark Beer Queso Fundido: In medium saucepan over medium-high heat, whisk beer. Bring to a medium boil then add cheese in small batches, stirring to melt each portion before another is added. When all the cheese is melted, stir in garlic and jalapeño, and pour into hot fondue pot or heated serving bowl. Serve immediately with fritters."
