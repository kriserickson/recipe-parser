    "Nacho Sauce: In blender jar, combine water, cashews, nutritional yeast flakes, salt, smoked paprika, granulated onion, cumin, and chipotle pepper (if using). Blend until the sauce is super smooth. Through the top of the blender jar with the motor on low, add the E-Z Gel through the top and blend for about 10 seconds until smooth. Let sit 5 minutes and blend again for another 5 to 10 seconds.",
    "Casserole: Grease the inside of the Crock Pot (or a 9 x 13-inch baking dish if using the oven). Cover the bottom with a thin layer of the enchilada sauce. Layer half of the tortillas, beans, chilies, corn, crumbles or strips, nacho sauce, and enchilada sauce into the dish. Repeat the layers with remaining ingredients, ending with the enchilada and nacho sauces.",
    "Cover and cook on low for 3 to 4 hours or high for 2 to 3 hours, or until hot and bubbly and the tortillas are tender when pierced. If not using a Crock Pot, cover the dish with foil and bake the casserole in a preheated 400Â°F oven for 40 minutes, remove the foil and bake another 10 minutes, or until hot and bubbly and the tortillas are tender when pierced.",
    "Serve the enchilada casserole hot with any or all of the toppings: scallions, cilantro, black olives, and jalapenos."
