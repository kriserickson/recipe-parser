    "Using a large mixing bowl, mix all ingredients until no lumps remain. Use jumbo yellow onion rings and slice about 3/4-inch thick.",
    "Coat the onion rings evenly in batter and deep fry at 350 degrees F in vegetable oil just until batter sticks to the rings. Remove the rings from the vegetable oil and drain well, then refrigerate the rings for 2 to 4 hours. You can keep refrigerated for 1 to 2 days loosely covered.",
    "When ready to serve, drop the onion rings into 350 degrees F vegetable oil until golden brown.",
    "This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant. The Food Network Kitchens chefs have not tested this recipe, in the proportions indicated, and therefore, we cannot make any representation as to the results.",
