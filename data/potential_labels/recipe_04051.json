    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.",
    "In a large non-stick pan, combine butter, pecans, brown sugar, corn syrup, salt and eggs. Cook on the stove top over medium-low heat just until thickened. (You don't want it dry, just slightly thickened, about the consistency of pudding). Remove from heat and set aside.",
    "Unroll dough and using a 3\" cookie cutter, cut out circles. Gently fold about ⅛-1/4\" up on the edges.",
    "Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pecan mixture into each circle.",
    "Place on a parchment lined pan (it's important to line it) and bake 8 minutes or until filling is just set. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.",
    "Place chocolate chips in a small Ziploc bag (use brand name, the store brands tend to leak). Microwave about 15 seconds or until mostly melted. Snip off a tiny corner of the baggie and drizzle chocolate over the cookies. Cool until set."
