    "Beat the eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt with a fork until almost blended with some yellow streaks remaining.",
    "Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Put the tortilla in it and turn until warm and pliable, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate.",
    "Raise the heat to medium-high. Add the oil to the skillet, then the scallion and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until just bright green and tender, about 30 seconds. Add the eggs, vigorously stir with a silicone spatula to scramble lightly, then quickly spread in an even layer. Scatter on the cilantro and pickled greens, if using, then immediately press the warmed tortilla on top and let cook until the egg just sets and sticks to the tortilla, about 30 seconds. Slide onto the plate.",
    "If using, drizzle the hoisin sauce and chile paste over the egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Fold in quarters and serve immediately or wrap in foil to eat out of hand."
