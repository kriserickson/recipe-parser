    "In a large bowl, combine the chopped onions, chopped red bell pepper, lean ground turkey, mashed potato, tamari sauce, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to mix well.",
    "Roll the mixture into balls (I made mine about 1 1/2 inches wide, and place in a skillet with a little bit of olive oil. Cook over medium heat until brown on all sides.",
    "Transfer to a casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes, or until cooked through.",
    "While the meatballs are baking, make the sauce.",
    "Place the chicken broth, tamari, coconut sugar, honey, ground ginger, chopped red pepper, and minced garlic in a sauce pan and simmer for about 5 minutes.",
    "Combine the cornstarch and water in a small container and shake well to remove lumps. Drizzle into the pan and stir well to combine. Continue to simmer until the sauce thickens, about 5 more minutes.",
    "Drizzle the sauce over the finished meatballs, and top with green onion. Serve over rice if desired, or insert toothpicks for an easy appetizer."
