    "Use a vegetable peeler to shave asparagus stalks into long, thin strips (about 4 cups shaved asparagus).",
    "Step 2",
    "Combine peas, mint, nuts, salt, half of cheese, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until a chunky puree forms. With motor running, slowly add oil, pouring in a thin, steady stream until a smoother puree forms.",
    "Step 3",
    "Fill a 12-inch high-sided skillet with 2 inches water. Bring water to a boil over high. Add pasta to skillet, and completely submerge; cook until al dente, about 8 to 12 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Drain pasta; return cooked pasta to pan. Add shaved asparagus to pasta; toss well for 1 minute until asparagus softens slightly. Add pea puree to pasta; toss well to coat. Stir in reserved cooking liquid, 1 tablespoon at a time, until sauce is slightly creamy and thoroughly coats pasta. Top with remaining half of cheese and serve."
