    "Place the steak in the center of a parchment-lined baking sheet. Scatter the tomatoes, asparagus, and red onion around the steak (I cut about half of the tomatoes in half), overlapping if necessary. Drizzle everything with the olive oil and then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Make sure to get both sides of the steak with the oil, salt, and pepper.",
    "Broil the steak for 5-6 minutes, flip, and broil for another 5-6 minutes for medium doneness. Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes before cutting.",
    "Thinly slice the steak, and toss the walnuts with the asparagus and tomatoes in a seperate bowl to combine. Pour off the steak and vegetable juices from the tray into a bowl and mix in the balsamic vinegar.",
    "Layer the spring mix, vegetables, steak, and then a few more vegetables. Crumble the gorgonzola on top. Drizzle with the balsamic mixture and serve warm."
