    "In a large bowl, combine mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, garlic powder, celery salt, dry mustard, pepper and paprika and mix well. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or up to 24 hours).",
    "After marinating, remove chicken from refrigerator and toss to coat in marinade mixture once again (to make sure pieces are well-coated). Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place breadcrumbs and parsley in a shallow dish, mixing together well. Roll marinated chicken pieces in crumb mixture to coat evenly on all sides. Place chicken pieces in a single layer on a large baking pan.",
    "Bake, uncovered, about 45 to 55 minutes (depending on size of chicken pieces you're using) or until juices run clear when tested with a fork, gently turning pieces halfway through cooking time. Remove to a warm platter and serve. We like to serve this with mashed potatoes and gravy."
