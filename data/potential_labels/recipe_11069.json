    "Preheat the oven to 180°C, gas mark 4",
    "Cream butter and sugars, once creamed, combine in the egg and vanilla.",
    "Sift in the flour and salt, then the chocolate chips.",
    "Roll into walnut size balls, for a more homemade look, or roll into a long, thick sausage shape and slice to make neater looking cookies.",
    "Place on ungreased baking paper. If you want to have the real Millies experience then bake for just 7 minutes, till the cookies are just setting - the cookies will be really doughy and delicious. Otherwise cook for 10 minutes until just golden round the edges.",
    "Take out of the oven and leave to harden for a minute before transferring to a wire cooling rack. These are great warm, and they also store well, if they don't all get eaten straight away!"
