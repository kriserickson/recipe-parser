    "Cut the stems off the mushrooms and wash gently. Place the mushroom(s) and the other ingredients, except the cheese, in a sealed container or large zip-top bag, and gently flip over several times to coat the mushrooms.",
    "Refrigerate, flipping every once in awhile. These are best if you can marinate them for at least a few hours (better yet, overnight), but an hour or two will do.",
    "On the grill, place the mushrooms gills-down first, and cook without moving for about 5 minutes. They become very fragile as they cook, so it's best to move them as little as possible.",
    "Gently flip them over and crumble the blue cheese onto the gills. Cook for a few more minutes as the cheese melts on top.",
    "To test for doneness, give the mushroom a little squeeze with a pair of tongs. If they bend easily throughout (not just the edges), that means they're cooked all the way through."
