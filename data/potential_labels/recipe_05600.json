    "METHOD",
    "Preheat the oven to 200°C. Butter a gratin dish large enough to hold twelve nectarine halves.",
    "Place the nectarines, cut-side up, in the gratin dish. Pour the orange juice into the dish and sprinkle the brown sugar and caster sugar over the nectarines. Bake for 20 minutes or until the nectarines are soft but not mushy. (This step can be done in advance.)",
    "Place the egg yolks in a small glass bowl and whisk in the brandy and lemon zest. Place the bowl over a saucepan of hot water over low heat. Whisk the yolks for 5 minutes or until light and fluffy. They must stay creamy but not scramble. Remove the bowl from the heat and fold in the whipped cream.",
    "Pour the cream mixture over the cooked nectarines. Cook under a medium grill (broiler) for 2–3 minutes or until slightly browned. Serve immediately."
