    "Rinse the radishes in cold water and clean/trim the root and stems.",
    "Thinly slice the radish bulb and set aside.",
    "Make the vinegar mixture in a small sauce pan by mixing them all and bring it to boil on low heat until the sugar melts (about 3- 4 mins). You can whisk it occasionally to promote the melting process.",
    "Put the sliced radish in a glass jar (I used a 1L jar.) and pour in the vinegar mixture. Let the jar cool down for a couple of hours and close the lid. Refrigerate the jar for overnight.",
    "Serve the radish pickles when required. (I found that the pickles taste better from the 2nd day onwards rather than on day zero or one.) It can be stored in the fridge for up to 4 days with still a good taste and the crunchy texture."
