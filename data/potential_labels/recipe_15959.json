    "Make the bottom layer: Combine the almond milk, almond butter, banana, cocoa powder, and dates in a blender. Blend until smooth and the dates are fully pureed. Add the ice and pulse. Pour into 3 glasses (or 4 smaller glasses) and freeze for 30 minutes.",
    "Make the middle layer: Combine the almond milk, bananas, dates, and vanilla in a blender and blend until smooth. Add the ice and pulse. Layer this onto the smoothies and freeze for another 30 minutes.",
    "Make the top layer: Combine the strawberries, raspberries, and almond milk in a blender and blend until smooth. This layer will be very thick. Remove the glasses from the freezer and spoon the last layer onto the smoothies. Sprinkle with chocolate chips, if desired.",
    "The bottom two layers, since they are not completely frozen, should thaw to a drinkable (spoonable) consistency in 5 to 10 minutes. Serve and enjoy."
