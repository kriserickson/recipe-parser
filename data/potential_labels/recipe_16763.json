    "Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid, 16 to 18 minutes (check only toward the end of cooking time). The rice should be studded with craters, or steam holes, when it is ready.",
    "Remove from heat and let steam, covered, for 10 minutes. Then fluff with a fork and serve."
