    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Preheat oven to 350º and spray a 9”-x-13” baking dish with non-stick spray. Warm a large, deep skillet over medium heat and add ground beef and onion. Brown the beef, crumbling it as it cooks, then drain fat and set aside. Add marinara and garlic, then reduce heat and simmer, 5 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, add ricotta, egg, Parmesan, parsley, and garlic powder, stirring to combine. Spoon 1/3 of the meat mixture into the prepared pan and spread across the bottom. Top with a single layer of ravioli, half of the ricotta mixture, and 1/3 of the sauce. Repeat layers, ending in marinara sauce.",
    "Sprinkle top with mozzarella and bake, covered, 40 minutes. Remove cover and bake 10 minutes more. Sprinkle with parsley and serve."
