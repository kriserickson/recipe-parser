    "While chicken cooks in the oven, combine orange juice, zest, water, rice vinegar, & soy sauce in a saucepan over medium heat for a few minutes. Stir in brown sugar, ginger, & garlic letting it come to a boil. Make a slurry with your cold water & cornstarch. Pour slurry into boiling sauce until it thickens. Keep warm.",
    "Once the chicken is out of the oven, spray a large saucepan/wok with pan coating & add chicken on high heat. Toss chicken a little bit & gradually add sauce until chicken is coated well. (The sauce should sizzle when it hits the pan.) Reserve leftover sauce.",
    "Serve chicken with rice, green onions & extra sauce."
