    "Preheat oven to 350°.",
    "Peel potatoes and place in cold water.",
    "In a small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and pepper to taste. Set aside.",
    "Pat potatoes dry and grate on the large holes of a grater. (Long grated shreds are best.)",
    "Place grated potatoes in a large bowl, add onion, and toss. Add flour mixture and toss, breaking up clumps. (This may take a bit of time, as the dry ingredients must be well distributed.) Add eggs and combine well.",
    "In a large nonstick skillet, heat about 1\" oil over high heat. Test heat by carefully dropping a little piece of potato in the oil. If it bubbles violently, the oil is ready.",
    "Using a slotted spoon, place spoonfuls of potato mixture (drained of excess liquid) into oil. Fry until just golden, about 2 minutes on each side. (They will not be cooked through.) Drain on paper towels. Continue until all potato mixture is used. Note: As you get toward the bottom of the bowl, the potatoes will be wetter. They will need to be pressed and will take a bit longer to cook. Arrange latkes on a baking sheet; transfer to oven and bake for about 10 minutes on each side. They will turn a rich golden brown. Season with salt to taste. Serve with applesauce and sour cream, if desired.",
