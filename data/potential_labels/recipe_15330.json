    "Making the dough:",
    "Measure the flour and shake it through a sieve into a medium sized mixing bowl. However, if you are making a mixed flour pasta, don’t try to sift or whisk the flours to blend them.",
    "Drop the eggs or egg yolks into a small bowl or measuring cup; beat briefly with a fork to break them up. Pour in the measured amounts of oil and water and mix well with the eggs.",
    "Pour the wet ingredients into the flour. Toss and mix everything with a fork until the flour is moistened and starts to clump together.",
    "Lightly flour with your hands, then gather the clumps-or use a flexible plastic dough scraper-and begin kneading right in the bowl, folding the ragged mass over, pushing and turning it, then folding again. Use the kneading action to clean the sides of the bowl.",
    "When you have formed a cohesive clump of dough, turn it out onto a small work surface lightly dusted with 1/2 teaspoon of flour and continue kneading for 2 to 3 minutes, until the dough is smooth and shiny on the outside, soft throughout, and stretchy.",
    "Form the dough into a disk and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 1/2 hour. Store, very well wrapped, in the refrigerator for a day, or for a month or more in the freezer. Defrost frozen dough slowly in refrigerator, and let it return to room temperature before rolling. Defrosted dough will need a bit more flour."
