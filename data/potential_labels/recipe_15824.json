    "Put the warm water, yeast, and brown sugar in a large glass bowl. Stir and let it sit for about 5 minutes so that the sugar feeds the yeast.",
    "Add the spelt flour, salt, and oil, and knead with your hands for a few minutes. If the dough seems too dry, add a bit more water. Once the dough is smooth and elastic, cover with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm place to rise for about a half hour.",
    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spread out some waxed paper, and sprinkle with flour. Take half of the dough and flatten it with your hands and shape into a rectangle. Place the pepperoni over the dough. Sprinkle with a half cup of dairy free cheese.",
    "Roll the dough into a log. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning. Place the bread on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.",
    "Repeat steps 3 and 4 with the other half of the dough.",
    "Bake at 375 for about 25-30 minutes. It should be golden brown on top. Brush with olive oil if desired and sprinkle with more Italian seasoning or sea salt if desired.",
    "To serve, heat some marinara sauce and spoon into individual ramekins. Cut the pepperoni bread into slices for dipping."
