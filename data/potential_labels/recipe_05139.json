    "When ready to cook, melt butter in a large oven-proof pan/skillet over medium high heat.",
    "Once your pan/skillet is sizzling hot, place chicken skin-side down in the pan/skillet, and sear both sides until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. Lift browned chicken out of the pan onto a plate and set aside.",
    "Add potatoes to the pan/skillet, and stir to coat each piece with the melted butter/chicken juice mixture in the pan/skillet.",

    "Place pan/skillet into oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork.",
    "Pull pan/skillet briefly out of the oven and add asparagus.",
    "Stir mixture lightly so that the asparagus and potatoes are evenly distributed in the pan/skillet.",
    "Place chicken in the pan/skillet on top of the asparagus and potatoes, then stick the whole thing back in the oven.",
    "Roast until the chicken is completely cooked through, about 25-30 minutes.",
    "Serve immediately, drizzled generously with your truffle honey mustard sauce."
