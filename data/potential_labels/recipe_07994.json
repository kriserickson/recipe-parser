    "First, salt and pepper your short ribs. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, brown the short ribs in oil. Remove and set aside. In the same pot, add the chopped onions, carrots, and celery. Cook until onions are translucent. Add the red wine, cook until some of the alcohol has burned off. Add the garlic, rosemary, tomato paste, beef broth, canned tomatoes and bay leaf. Return the browned short ribs, bring to a boil. Cover and lower heat to a simmer. Simmer for three hours or until the meat is very tender.",
    "Transfer the meat to a separate bowl, remove the bones, and pull apart the meat; return to the pot. Give it a stir so all the meat is coated in the sauce. Keep warm until ready to serve.",
    "Serve with pasta or over mashed potatoes."
