    "Drain the chickpeas and add them to a food processor along with the olive oil, juice from the lemon (about 1/4 cup), tahini, garlic, cumin, and salt. Pulse the ingredients, adding a small amount of water if needed to keep it moving, until the hummus is smooth.",
    "Slice the scallions (both white and green ends) and pull the parsley leaves from the stems. Add the green onion and parsley to the hummus in the food processor and process again until only small flecks of green remain. Taste the hummus and adjust the salt, lemon, or garlic if needed.",
    "Cook 8oz. of your favorite pasta according to the package directions. Reserve one cup of the starchy cooking water, then drain the cooked pasta in a colander. Return the drained pasta to the pot with the heat turned off. Add about 3/4 of the hummus to the pasta and stir until the pasta is evenly coated (add more hummus if needed). Add the reserved pasta water as needed to keep the mixture smooth and saucy. Serve immediately."
