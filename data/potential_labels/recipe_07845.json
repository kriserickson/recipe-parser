    "Using a serrated knife, cut 1/2 inch off the top of each artichoke. Cut each in half vertically and, using scissors, trim the pointy ends off the leaves. Carefully cut out the fuzzy choke in the center and discard. Rub artichokes all over with lemon. Fill a large pot with water and fit with a steaming rack. Place artichokes on rack and steam until they are tender and easily pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, preheat grill to high heat. In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, harissa, honey, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and stir well. Set aside.",
    "Spray the cut side of each artichoke with cooking spray. Sprinkle with salt and remaining pepper. Grill artichokes, cut side down, until nicely charred, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve hot with dipping sauce."
