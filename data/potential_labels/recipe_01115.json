Roast for 20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are golden brown, and the pepper's skin has started to blacken in spots.",

    "Remove the roasting sheet from the oven. When the poblano is cool to the touch, remove the ribbing and seeds and chop into 1/2 inch pieces. (or, optional: leave it in the oven until it's blistered so you can peel the skin before you chop it).",
