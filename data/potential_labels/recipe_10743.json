    "Heat small, nonstick skillet over medium.",
    "Cover the bottom of hot skillet evenly with shredded mozzarella cheese.",
    "Lightly spread the crushed tomatoes on top of the cheese, using the back of a spoon, and leaving a border around the edges of the cheese crust.",
    "Sprinkle with garlic powder and dried basil or Italian seasoning. Arrange pepperoni on top.",
    "Cook until sizzling, bubbled, and edges are brown. Try to lift up the edges of the pizza with a spatula. When it is ready, it will easily lift up from the pan. If it sticks, that means it's not quite ready. Keep lifting and checking frequently. When it finally starts to lift up easily without sticking, work spatula gently and slowly underneath to loosen up entire pizza and transfer to a cutting board.",
    "Sprinkle lightly with Parmesan, fresh torn basil leaves, and crushed red pepper, if desired.",
    "Allow to cool for about 5 minutes. The crust will firm up even more while it cools. Cut with a pizza cutter, transfer to a serving plate, and enjoy!"
