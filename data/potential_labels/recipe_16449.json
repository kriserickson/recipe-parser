    "Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil. Add the soy curls and let them cook until soft. Then drain them, carefully press excess water out and set them aside.",
    "In a large non-stick pot, add the vegan butter and bring it to high heat. Add the soy curls and spices. Stir to combine. Let them get brown and crispy spots.",
    "Add the shallots to the soy curls, stir. Once the shallots are soft, add the minced garlic. Let it cook for another 2-3 minutes. Then turn down the heat to low.",
    "Add the tomato purée and coconut milk. Stir and add more spices to taste. I've added another 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of garam masala.",
    "Let the curry cook until everything is hot and bubbly. Then it's ready to serve! I've made basmati rice and garlic naan to go with it, and sprinkled everything with fresh cilantro."
