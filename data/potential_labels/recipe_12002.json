    "In a food process or blender, grind up the pretzels to a very fine crumb. Place them in a bowl. In a separate bowl, Mix the eggs with 2 tablespoons water. Place the flour in a third bowl.",
    "Slice the two packages of goat cheese in half, then in quarters, totaling 8 thick slices of goat cheese. (If the cheese is overly soft, place them in the freezer for 20 minutes before slicing.) Grab one slice and dredge it in flour, shaking off the excess. Dip it in the egg wash, turning it a couple of times to make sure it coats the flour. Finally, drop it in the pretzel crumbs and turn it over to coat. Repeat with the rest of the slices.",
    "Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add four slices to the skillet and fry them on the first side for about 45 seconds, or until golden. (The breading should gently sizzle; if it sizzles too much/fries too fast, turn down the heat.) Turn them slices over using a slotted spoon and fry the other side for about 30-45 seconds, or until golden and crisp. Remove them to a paper towel lined plate. Repeat with the other four slices.",
    "Serve with marinara sauce and a sprinkling of parsley."
