    "Heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole dish with a lid. Add the onions and peppers, and cook for 10 mins until softened. Add the curry paste and nigella seeds, stir for 1 min, then add the split peas, tomatoes, coconut milk and coriander stalks. Bring to a simmer, then cover and bubble gently for 45 mins, or until the split peas are tender. If eating at different times, turn off the heat and cover the curry with a lid. Reheat on the hob or in a microwave until piping hot, adding a splash of water if the curry looks too thick.",
    "Just before serving, add the lime zest and juice, coconut yogurt and generous seasoning. Serve with rice or naan, with a dollop of yogurt on top and scattered with coriander leaves."
