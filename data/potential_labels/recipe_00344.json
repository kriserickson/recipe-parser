    "Place pearl barley in a small saucepan and cover with plenty of water and boil for 30 to 35 minutes, until tender but with a bite. Pour into a fine sieve; shake to remove all the water and transfer to a large bowl. Break the feta into rough pieces, about ¾ inch (2 cm) in size and mix in a small bowl with 1 ½ tbsp. (22 mL) of the olive oil, the za’atar, coriander seeds and the cumin. Gently mix together and leave to marinate while you prepare the rest of the salad.",
    "Chop parsley fine and place in a bowl with the green onions, garlic, cashew nuts, pepper, allspice, lemon juice, the remaining olive oil and the cooked barley. Mix together well and season to taste. To serve, divide the salad among the four plates and top with the marinated feta.",
    "Makes 4 servings."
