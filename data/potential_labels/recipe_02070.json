    "Pour the coconut milk into a jar with a screw top lid.",
    "Chia seed mixture",
    "Add the chia seeds, and maple syrup or honey, then replace the lid and shake the jar well. The recipe will turn out fine without any sweetener, if you prefer just the coconut flavor on its own.",
    "Shake the mixture",
    "Let the sealed jar sit in the fridge for 2 - 3 hours, so that the chia seeds absorb the coconut liquid. They should expand to four times their original size and become translucent and gelatinous.",
    "Spoon the mixture into glasses",
    "Add the strawberry pulp to the bottom of a glass (optional) and spoon the coconut and chia seed mixture on top.",
    "Serve your Coconut, Strawberry and Chia Puddings chilled for a gluten free dessert or super healthy breakfast treat. You'll be pleasantly surprised at just how delicious such a simple recipe can be. Enjoy."
