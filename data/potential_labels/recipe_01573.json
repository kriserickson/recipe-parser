    "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, seasoning them with a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, seasoning with a pinch of salt; turn the heat up to medium-high. Cook until mushrooms are browned and have given up their liquid, 5 minutes.",
    "Transfer the onions and mushrooms to a bowl. Add another tablespoon oil to the skillet if needed to cook the chicken. Season the chicken with salt and pepper; place in the skillet, skin side down. Cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 12 minutes total.",
    "Pour in the wine; turn the heat to low. Simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Return the onions and mushrooms to the skillet; add the peas and oregano. Stir to coat the vegetables with the pan juices. Cook until heated through. Taste for seasonings. â€“ Chicago Tribune/McClatchy-Tribune Information Services"
