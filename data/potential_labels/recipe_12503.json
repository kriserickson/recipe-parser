    "In a 5-6 quart slow cooker, combine onion soup mix, chicken broth, cream of chicken soup and pork gravy mix. Whisk together until combined. Don’t worry about any lumps, they will go away during cooking.",
    "Note: I find this works better in an oval slow cooker instead of a round one. The chops cook more evenly. Season both sides of the chops with a little bit of garlic powder.",
    "Place pork chops into the slow cooker. Do your best to spread them out and cover with the gravy mixture.",
    "Cover and cook on low about 4-6 hours.",
    "Just before the pork chops are done. Whisk together the corn starch and cold water in a small bowl.",
    "Once it is smooth, pour it in with your pork chops in the slow cooker and stir gently. Cover and switch the slow cooker to high and cook for another 30 minutes (until gravy has thickened.) Then serve with mashed potatoes!"
