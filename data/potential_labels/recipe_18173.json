    "Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Check your crust at 45 minutes and if too brown, cover with foil until the pie is fully baked in the center. A knife inserted should come out clean.",
    "Serve with your favorite whipped topping or vanilla ice cream. In true Texas form, use Blue Bell!",

    "Alternatively, you can use 1/2 cup light corn syrup and 1/2 cup dark corn syrup to achieve the rich mahogany color of classic pecan pies."
