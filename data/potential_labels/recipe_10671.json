    "Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and set a steamer on top. Steam the sweet potato, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, until fork tender. Turn off heat and let sit for 5 minutes.",
    "Transfer sweet potato (about 1 cup/250 mL) to a food processor and add the maple syrup. Process until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the bowl as necessary. Taste and adjust sweetness. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least a few hours or up to overnight to thicken. If too thick, you can thin it out with a little almond milk."
