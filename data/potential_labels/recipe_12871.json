    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to beat together the butter and erythritol, until it's fluffy and light in color.",
    "Beat in the vanilla extract. Beat in the almond flour, 1/2 cup at a time. (The dough will be dense and a little crumbly, but should stick when pressed together.)",
    "Scoop rounded tablespoonfuls of the dough onto the prepared cookie sheet. Flatten each cookie to about 1/3\" thick. (You can make them thicker or thinner to your liking. Keep in mind they will not spread or thin out during baking, so make them as thin as you want them when done.)",
    "Bake for about 12 minutes, until the edges are golden. Allow to cool completely in the pan before handling (cookies will harden as they cool)."
