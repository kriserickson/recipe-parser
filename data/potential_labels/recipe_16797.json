    "In a food processor, process almonds, walnuts, oats, cinnamon, and salt to a fine meal. Add honey and vanilla, and process just to combine. Next, add chocolate chips and pulse just to combine. Roll dough into balls using a tablespoon measuring spoon for required size. Place on a parchment lined cookie sheet and freeze until firm, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer to a covered container and store in the freezer. These can be eaten straight from the freezer, no thawing required.",
