    "Measure out all the spices except the cumin seeds and put them in a small bowl.",
    "Let the ghee (clarified butter) melt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. (Ghee is the traditional Indian choice, but you can substitute butter if you can't find ghee.) Once the ghee begins to sizzle, add the cumin seeds and stir for about 5 seconds. Add the onion and saute for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ginger and jalapeno and cook for 1 more minute. Add the spices and then the pureed tomatoes. Mix, then put a lid on the pan and let everything cook down for 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "Once the tomato has reduced and the ghee starts to separate from the sauce, add the chickpeas and water. Mix, then bring it to a boil before reducing to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, then squish a few chickpeas with a spoon to thicken the sauce. Garnish with yogurt and cilantro. For a full meal, serve over rice or with roti."
