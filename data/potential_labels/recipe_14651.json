    "Preheat the oven to 400° F. Juice and zest one orange and halve the other.",
    "To a blender, add 2 teaspoons of the orange juice, the cumin, cinnamon, allspice, red pepper flakes, clove of garlic, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and apple cider vinegar. Blend until combined, season with salt and pepper, and adjust to taste.",
    "In a medium bowl, combine the squash, chickpeas, marinade, and unjuiced orange halves. Spread the mixture onto a rimmed baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes, until the squash is caramelized and soft enough to eat and the chickpeas are crunchy.",
    "Let cool to room temp. Meanwhile, make the dressing: Whisk together the remaining fresh orange juice, the zest, 2 teaspoons apple cider, 6 tablespoons olive oil, the tahini, and the juice from the roasted oranges. Season with salt and pepper, taste, and adjust as you like.",
    "Transfer the vegetables to a big plate or bowl, drizzle shyly with dressing (you can always add more later), add the red onion and cilantro, toss to combine, and serve immediately."
