    "In a small bowl, mix the corn starch with the water. Stir to blend well. Set aside.",
    "Bring to boil the chicken broth and water in a pot. Add the tomato, white pepper, salt, and thicken the soup with the corn starch mixture. Stir the soup with a ladle and turn off the heat. Swirl the beaten eggs into the soup and immediately stir around for three times with a pair of chopsticks. Cover the pot with its lid for 2 minutes. The eggs should be cooked and form into silken threads. Dish out into individual serving bowls and serve immediately."
