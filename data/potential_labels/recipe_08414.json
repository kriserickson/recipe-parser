    "Whisk coconut oil, nut butter and protein powder in a medium bowl until smooth. Add remaining ingredients an stir. Line baking sheet/cake pan with parchment paper, making sure it goes all the way up the sides. Pour in batter, and don’t let the batter touch the actual pan or it will be very messy to remove. Cover and refrigerate for about 2 hours or until solid. Lift bars out with parchment paper underneath and cut into squares on a cutting board (as pictured).",
    "Store bars in refrigerator!! This recipe must be kept pretty cold. If they get too warm, the coconut oil will melt and they will turn back into a puddle."
