    "Roast the poblano peppers over a gas burner (leave them directly on the burner grate and turn them occasionally), under a broiler, or over a gas grill until the skins are roughly blackened and charred. (See more instructions here on roasting peppers.) Set them aside to cool.",
    "Core the tomatoes and chop them roughly. Roughly chop the red onion. Lop off the stems of the peppers, and put everything into a blender or food processor with the lime juice and a sprinkle of salt. Blend until combined. Add a few tablespoons of water if you wish to thin it out. Taste and add more salt if necessary.",
    "Garnish with cilantro leaves and serve with chips, or over beans and rice."
