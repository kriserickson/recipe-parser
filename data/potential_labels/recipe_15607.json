    "Mix the soy sauce with the vinegar in a bowl and dip in the tempeh squares. Set them aside for a minute or two. In the mean time, cut your veggies.",
    "Heat a skillet with some oil and fry the tempeh on medium heat. Take it out of the pan when it's done. Keep the pan on the heat and use it to saut√© the peppers, broccoli and carrot. Cover with a lid and cook for a minute or two so the veggies keep some of their bite. At the same time also stir fry the cauliflower rice with some oil in another pan until tender.",
    "In a small bowl, mix the chili paste, vinegar, soy sauce, oil and sweetener. Add a little water if the sauce is too thick. Divide the cauliflower rice over two plates and put the tempeh, peppers, broccoli, carrot and raw cucumber on top. Pour the chili sauce over the veggies and tempeh and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Mix everything on your plate before eating.",
