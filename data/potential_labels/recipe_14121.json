    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a standard loaf pan with coconut oil.",
    "In a small bowl, combine the coconut oil and honey.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk the salt, eggs, vanilla extract and almond extract. Whisk in the coconut oil and honey mixture. Next, whisk in the coconut flour until completely combined with no lumps. Lastly, stir in the mashed bananas.",
    "Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and top with the shredded coconut.",
    "Bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. If your coconut topping is browning fast, tent some aluminum foil on top to prevent burning.",
    "Let cool completely (or as long as you can wait!) before removing from the loaf pan and serving. Keep refrigerated."
