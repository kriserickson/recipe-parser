    "To start, you’ll need to soak the cashews. The best way to do this is overnight in the fridge, but if you’re strapped for time use boiling water and soak for half an hour. When ready, drain and rinse well before use.",
    "Next, place the cubed potatoes in a microwave safe, shallow bowl and cover with saran wrap. Microwave for about 5 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork tender. Set aside until ready to use.",
    "Place all the soup base ingredients in a blender, including the soaked cashews and cooked potatoes. Blend on high for a couple minutes, until the mixture is silky smooth. Add additional water as needed to achieve your desired soup thickness or thinness.",
    "Transfer to a soup pot and heat on low, whisking occasionally.",
    "Now it’s time to make the confit. Heat the oil in a small sauté pan over medium heat.",
    "Add the chopped mushrooms, celery, onion, and garlic and sauté for about 5 minutes, turning the heat to medium-high.",
    "When almost finished cooking, sprinkle in the salt and the liquid smoke, to taste. Stir well. The confit is done when the celery is somewhat softened. The mushrooms and onions should be cooked thoroughly.",
    "Serve a small piling of the confit in the middle of a hot bowl of the chowder and enjoy!"
