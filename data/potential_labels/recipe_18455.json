  "title": "HAZELNUT CREPES WITH ROASTED PINEAPPLE YOGURT, BUCKWHEAT SPRINKLES, AND SALTED CARAMEL BANANAS (VEGAN + GRAIN-FREE)\nMarch 6, 2019\nThis breakfast from a few Sundays ago may go down as one of the best I’ve ever had. I had so much fun creating these recipes– I love to make things up as I go, seeing what I have on hand, thinking about which ingredients would taste good together, look good together, and make me feel good—which is why everything is free of gluten, grains, refined sugar, and dairy. There’s a lot going on here– feel free to make as many of the sides/toppings as you’d like…you can also simply make the crepes and fill them with whatever your heart desires. Enjoy!",

  "ingredients": [
    "0",
    "For the Hazelnut Crepes:",
    "1/2 cup hazelnut flour (simply blend raw hazelnuts in high speed blender or food processor)",
    "1/2 cup arrowroot flour (can sub with tapioca flour)",
    "1 cup coconut milk (full fat, canned)",
    "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon",
    "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "Recipe notes:",
    "*if you want to make a savory crepe–you can omit the cinnamon and vanilla",
    "*you can also make this recipe using almond flour if you don’t have hazelnuts",
    "Directions:",
    "Heat a large non stick skillet over medium high heat. You don’t need to add any oil because the oils from the coconut milk will provide enough fat (as long as you’re using nonstick). Pour about 1/4 cup of batter in at a time, swirl the pan around until the batter is coating the pan as thinly as possible. Let it cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until bubbles appear. Flip and cook an additional 3 to 5 minutes (or longer if you like them crispy).",
    "For the Turmeric Buckwheat Sprinkles:",
    "3 tablespoons buckwheat groats",
    "3 tablespoons ground hazelnuts",
    "2 teaspoons coconut sugar",
    "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon",
    "1/4 teaspoon turmeric",
    "Directions:",
    "In a small pan over medium heat, add all of the ingredients and stir to combine and evenly distribute spices. Toast until fragrant and golden (about 5 to 7 minutes).",
    "For the Roasted Pineapple Yogurt",
    "1/3 cup pineapple (diced)",
    "1/2 cup yogurt (I like coconut yogurt –click here for my recipe)",
    "Directions:",
    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spread out the diced pineapple on a parchment lined baking sheet and roast for 10 to 15 minutes. You don’t need to add anything to the pineapples, simply roasting them will bring out amazing flavor and make them soft for mashing. After roasting, remove from the oven and let them cool—then mash the roasted pineapple in a bowl and incorporate coconut yogurt.",
    "Salted Caramel Bananas:",
    "1 banana",
    "1 teaspoon coconut oil",
    "2 teaspoons date syrup (can sub with maple syrup)",
    "pinch of sea salt (to taste)",
    "Directions:",
    "In a small skillet, warm up the oil over medium heat. Add in the sliced banana, date syrup, and sea salt. Mix everything up and then let the banana slices get golden brown in the oil. Let them cook for 10 minutes, flipping halfway to ensure even browning."
