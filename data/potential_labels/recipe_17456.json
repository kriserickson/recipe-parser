    "CUT each carrot in half, then cut each half lengthwise into equal-sized batons. BOIL the carrots for 7 minutes until just tender. WHILE the carrots are cooking, place the cumin and coriander seeds in a dry pan and lightly toast for 2-3 minutes over a medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally (when you start to smell the spices you know they're ready). REMOVE from the heat and put the seeds into a mortar and pestle and roughly grind them, leaving a little bit of texture. ADD the salt, garlic, olive oil and lemon juice and mix together until well combined. TOSS the mixture with the carrots and mint to thoroughly coat."
