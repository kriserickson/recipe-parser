    "1 Rinse and pat dry the chicken wing drummettes. Place them in a large bowl or marinade bag. Mix together the marinade ingredients—crushed garlic cloves, honey, mustard, soy sauce, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper—and pour over the chicken wing drummettes to coat. Chill for at least an hour or up to 24 hours.",
    "2 Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a roasting pan with foil and place a baking rack over it. Place the chicken wings in on the rack in a single layer with some space between the wings. Bake for 25-35 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken wing drummettes, until cooked through and well browned."
