    "Instructions",
    "Heat the olive oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the onions, ginger, and garlic.",
    "Stir everything for about a minute or two, and add the beef. Let it cook until it is no longer bright pink. Add the carrots, tomatoes (including the juice), and pepper, and let it cook for a few minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, and add the harissa, cumin, cinnamon, and paprika.",
    "Once the liquids start to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the garbanzo beans, collard greens, and salt. Let everything simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes. The chili should look thicker than what you started out with.",
    "Turn off the heat and mix in most of the cilantro, saving some for garnish. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving. The flavors develop more if you let the chili sit for a bit!"
