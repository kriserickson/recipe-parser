    "Season the chicken with adobo, garlic powder, cumin and oregano. Marinate it for 2 hours or overnight (depending on your timeframe).",
    "In a big pot, heat 1/4 cup of oil on medium-high heat. Place the seasoned chicken skin-side down and brown for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. The chicken will still be raw on the inside.",
    "Add 5 tablespoons of sofrito to the browned chicken and cook for 5 minutes.",
    "Add the tomato sauce, olives, cilantro sprigs, and Sazón Knorr package, and bring to a boil.",
    "Add the carrots and enough water to cover the chicken. Cover with lid and cook on medium-high heat for 10 minutes.",
    "After 10 minutes, add salt to taste and add the potatoes. Cook uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes to thicken the sauce. Enjoy!"
