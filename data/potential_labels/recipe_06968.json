    "In a small sauce pan, add all of the ingredients and turn the heat to medium. Whisk well as it warms up and the ingredients become smooth. Once it comes to a boil, whisk continuously for about a minute or so until it starts to thicken up. That's it! It happens quickly, no need to cook long. The longer you cook it, the thicker it will get. Remove from the heat and let it slightly cool before serving. If using on pancakes or you want to thin it out, add a little water to desired thickness.",
    "Note: this caramel will thicken even more as it sits, so just gently reheat it or add some water to thin it out some, if desired. I added water to mine the next day."
