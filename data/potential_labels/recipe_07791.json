    "ingredients:",
    "2 tablespoons ground organic coffee",
    "2 tablespoons organic turbinado or other large granulated sugar*^",
    "1 tablespoon organic smoked paprika",
    "2 teaspoons coarse sea salt",
    "2 teaspoons organic granulated garlic",
    "2 teaspoons organic onion flakes",
    "2 teaspoons organic paprika",
    "1-2 teaspoons organic orange peel (use 1 if pre-dried, 2 if fresh)",
    "ingredient notes & swaps:",
    "coffee – use decaf if you’re sensitive to caffeine",
    "garlic – if you can find roasted garlic flakes and/or just garlic flakes, use them",
    "onion – use flakes if you can find them, otherwise use granulated",
    "sugar – I believe my version is lower in sugar than the original TJs version judging partly by sight and partly by taste. To make it closer to the TJs, you may want to use 3 tablespoons of the sugar and/or a dark type of sugar (they use brown) in the mix. I think organic maple sugar would be amazing in this mixture",
    "orange peel – to be more precise, use clementine peel if you can find clementines",
