    "Combine all ingredients using food processor or blender. Let mixture rest for 7-8 minutes to allow coconut flour to absorb some of liquid.",
    "Preheat a lightly oiled 10-inch nonstick skillet over low-medium heat.",
    "Once moderately heated, pour ¼ cup or so of the batter into the center while tilting to spread the batter to about 7-8 inches in diameter. Flip tortilla once the top is no longer shinny and sticky. Repeat for second one.",
    "At this point the skillet is most likely fully heated. So, reapply oil and *pickup* the skillet and pour batter using same tilt technique and place back onto burner. Repeat for fourth one.",
    "Place each on parchment paper and slightly wipe off any access oil. Do not stack as they may stick to each other."
