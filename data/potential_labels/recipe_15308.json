    "For the marinade: Combine all of the ingredients in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, and cook at a rapid simmer until reduced to 1½ cups, about 20 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, for the meatballs: Combine all the ingredients except the flour and vegetable oil in a large bowl, and mix well. Roll the mixture into about three dozen -bite–sized meatballs. Flatten slightly into patties. In a large nonstick skillet, over -medium–high heat, heat about ½ inch vegetable oil. Lightly dredge the meatballs in the flour, and brown in batches until cooked through, about 8 minutes per batch. Drain the meatballs on a -paper–towel–lined plate, and place them in one layer or two snug layers in a serving dish.",
    "Strain the marinade over the meatballs. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes, turning once or twice, before serving.",
    "This dish can also be made a day ahead and left to marinate in the refrigerator overnight. Bring to room temperature or reheat before serving."
