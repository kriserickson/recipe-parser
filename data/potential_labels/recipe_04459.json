    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the cabbage for 2 minutes then carefully strain. Set aside.",
    "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the onions, garlic, and ginger until the onions are softened. Add the diced veggies and cook until they start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add tempeh and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, cook for 3 -4 more minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes, then combine the tempeh mixture, rice, and beaten egg in a large bowl. Stir in the remaining soy sauce and rice vinegar.",
    "Preheat the oven to 400°F. Assemble the cabbage rolls. Lay a prepared cabbage leaf down with the stem end facing you. Place about 1/3 cup tempeh mixture into the stem end of the cabbage leaf. Fold in the sides and roll up the leaf, then place the bundle, seam side down, in one of the baking dishes. Re- peat with the rest of the cabbage leaves and tempeh mixture.",
    "Whisk together the sauce ingredients, and pour it over the cabbage rolls. Bake for 35 minutes. Serve drizzled with the pan juices."
