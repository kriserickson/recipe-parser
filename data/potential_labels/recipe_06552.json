    "Method:",
    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "Cut the carrots and parnsips into 1/2″ chunks. Toss the carrots and parsnips with the olive oil, cumin, lime zest, salt, pepper, and half of the minced onions (reserve the rest of the onions for garnishing your tacos).",
    "Spread the carrot mixture in an even layer on a baking sheet. Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until the carrots and parnsips are fork tender. (Be careful not to overcook, I prefer my carrots to still have a bit of crunch!). Once the carrots are roasted to your liking, remove from the oven and set aside until you are ready to assemble the tacos.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the black beans in a small pan on the stove.",
    "To assemble the chimichurri, pulse the garlic cloves and serrano chili together in a food processor. Add in the carrot greens, cilantro, salt, pepper, and lime juice and process while pouring the olive oil in a steady stream. Blend until the mixture is well combined. (Note: I prefer my chimichurri to have a little bit of texture, so I’m careful not to over-mix.)",
    "To assemble the tacos, fill each tortilla with a heaping spoonful of black beans and a heaping spoonful of the roasted veggies. Top with diced onions, cotija cheese, and the chimichurri. Garnish with lime juice and a dash of your favorite hot sauce!"
