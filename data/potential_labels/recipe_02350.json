    "Cooking Instructions:",
    "Pre-heat the oven to 425 with a roasting pan inside.",
    "Cut the potatoes into 1/2 inch thick French fires. Parboil in a pan of salted water for about 5-7 minutes until just tender. Drain and pat dry.",
    "Put a single layer of potatoes on the roasting pan and scatter the garlic and herbs over them. Drizzle generously with olive oil (this step is important if you want crispy fries) and sprinkly with salt and pepper.. Use a pair of tongs to toss the potatoes and coat well with your seasoning mixture and the olive oil.",
    "Bake for 10-15 minutes until the fries are golden brown and crisp, turning a few times during the baking. Drain on paper towels and serve! These go really well with Lela’s Famous Burgers.",
