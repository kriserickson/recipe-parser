    "STEP 1: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Brown the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until no pink meat remains. Stir the meat well while it is cooking to break up large chunks and make sure all of it is cooked through.",
    "STEP 2: Add the taco seasoning and approx. 2/3 cup water (as directed on seasoning packet). Stir well and let simmer until the liquid evaporates and the mixture is thick and saucy.",
    "STEP 3: Add the refried beans to the meat mixture and stir until it is well combined and heated all the way through. This mixture can get thick and sticky so stir well!",
    "STEP 4: Using spray oil, coat the inside of a large casserole dish. If you skip this step the enchiladas will stick and you’ll just have one big mess when you try to dish them out. Warm your stack of tortillas in the microwave for about 30 seconds to make them more flexible.",
    "STEP 5: Take approximately 1/3 cup of the bean and meat mixture and put it inside of a tortilla. Wrap the beans up in the tortilla burrito-style (how to roll a burrito). Place the rolled enchilada in the casserole dish, seam side down. Do the same for the remaining 9 enchiladas and pack them tightly into the casserole dish.",
    "STEP 6: Once all of the rolled enchiladas are in the dish, evenly pour the entire can of enchilada sauce over top. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the whole dish. Place the dish in the preheated oven (350) and bake for approximately 20 min. or until its all bubbly around the edges.",
    "STEP 7: Sprinkle the chopped green onions all over the top and enjoy!",
    "Notes: NORMALLY I would have liked a bunch of fresh cold crispy shredded lettuce on top for added texture but for some reason the grocery store that I went to today was completely out of lettuce. Yep, you heard right. Out of lettuce. Anyway, a bag of shredded lettuce only costs about $1 (or $0.10 more per serving). Add the lettuce after reheating each serving to maintain its yummy crispness."
