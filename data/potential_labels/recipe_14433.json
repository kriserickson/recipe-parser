    "Preheat oven to 325F and line 9 muffin cups with paper liners (I recommend parchment paper liners for easy release).",
    "In the bottom of a good strong blender (I recommend Blendtec), add eggs, almond milk or water and vanilla extract. Blend briefly to combine.",
    "Add almond flour, coconut flour, coca powder, sweetener, baking powder and salt. Blend on medium high until smooth (you may need to scrape down sides of blender a little to make sure everything combines). Add melted coconut oil and blend until combined.",
    "Stir in all but 1 tbsp of chocolate chips. Divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups and top each with a few more chocolate chips.",
    "Bake 22 to 25 minutes, until firm to the touch. Remove and let cool in pan."
