    "Peel and boil the potato for about 10 minutes or until knife slices into it super easy-like. Meanwhile, place the feta, Greek yogurt, and dill in a food processor. Process until smooth. Add more yogurt as needed. Chill. Grate the cucumber and toss with vinegar, salt, and pepper. Chill.",
    "Transfer cooked potato to a medium bowl. Add one tablespoon of olive oil, garlic, shallot, and chick peas. Mash until pretty smooth, but still a little bit chunky (follow your heart). Add the lemon zest, hot sauce, spices, and egg. Stir together. Add panko bread crumbs, crumbling as you add them to the mixture. Stir together. Divide into 8 patties, less or more depending on the bun size you’re working with.",
    "Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Cook burgers for about 4 minutes on each side, or until browned and crisped. Serve on toasted buns with whipped feta and cucumber slaw."
