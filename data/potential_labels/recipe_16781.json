    "Preheat oven to 450ÂºF. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and grease with coconut oil.",
    "Grate and finely chop the zucchini. Drain the zucchini as much as possible.",
    "In a large bowl, combine zucchini, 1/2 cup grated mozzarella, oregano, almond meal, grated Parmesan, garlic powder, salt, and lightly beaten egg. Mix well.",
    "Ball up crust mixture and place on greased baking sheet. Using your fingers, press the mixture into a pizza crust shape, taking care not to make the edges too thin. Bake crust for 8 minutes. Switch oven over to broil, and broil crust for 4 more minutes. Crust should be slightly browned. Take crust out, add sauce, fresh mozzarella (sliced and broken into chunks), and fresh basil (roughly torn). Place pizza back in oven and broil for 3 more minutes. Enjoy!"
