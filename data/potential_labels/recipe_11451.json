    "Directions",
    "In 7- to 8-quart saucepot, cover potatoes with cold water. Stir in 2 tablespoon salt. Partially cover and heat to boiling on high. Reduce heat to maintain simmer; cook 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain well; return to pot. Potatoes can be parboiled and held at room temperature up to 2 hours before roasting.",
    "While potatoes simmer, preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Vigorously toss potatoes with oil; arrange in single layer on 2 large rimmed baking sheets. Roast 20 minutes or until golden brown and crisp, rotating sheets on racks halfway through and stirring once or twice.",
    "Meanwhile, in large bowl, whisk parsley, vinegar, capers, anchovy paste, garlic, remaining oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Toss potatoes with vinaigrette until well coated."
