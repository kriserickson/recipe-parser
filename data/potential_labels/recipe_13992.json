    "Mix 1/2 cup Dijon mustard in a bowl with the paprika, black pepper and the salt. Toss the chicken pieces in the mustard mixture, lifting the chicken skin and rubbing some of the mustard mixture beneath. Set aside.",
    "Add the olive oil to the skillet and add the chicken pieces to the skillet in a single layer over medium-high heat. Brown them well on one side, then flip them over and brown them on the other side. Transfer the chicken to a platter. Discard the oil.",
    "Heat a skillet with a lid or a Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the bacon. Cook the bacon, stirring frequently until they are softened and slightly browned. Remove the bacon from the skillet and set aside. Leave about 1 tablespoon bacon fat in the skillet, discarding the rest.",
    "Add the onion to the skillet and cook until soft and translucent. Stir in the thyme and cook for a couple of minutes before adding the chicken pieces. Add the wine. Cover and cook the chicken over low to medium heat, turning the chicken a few times, until the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.",
    "Stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard, the mustard seeds or grainy mustard, and the heavy cream into skillet. Add water to thin the sauce. Simmer a little bit, top the chicken with chopped parsley and serve immediately."
