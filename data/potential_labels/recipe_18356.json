    "Add the lentils and bay leaf to a pot with water covering them by 3 inches. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer, cooking uncovered for 15-20 minutes, or until al dente (but not mushy). Once the lentils are done, drain and set aside to cool.",
    "Meanwhile, add the vegetables (onion through parsley) to a mixing bowl. Make the dressing by combining the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and salt in a jar or small bowl.",
    "Once the lentils have cooled, combine them with the vegetables and toss with the dressing. Mix in desired amount of feta. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.",
    "Leftovers will keep fresh in the fridge for several days."
