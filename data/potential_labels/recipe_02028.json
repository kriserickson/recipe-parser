    "Preheat oven to 180 °C. Steam the pumpkin for 3 minutes, then cool. Plunge spinach into boiling water until wilted and drain well to remove excess liquid. In a large bowl combine drained spinach ricotta, onion and parsley. Arrange 3 sheets of lasagne on the base of an ovenproof pan (33cm x 23cm). Top with 1/3 each of pumpkin, tomato sauce and spinach ricotta mixture. Repeat twice and top with remaining lasagne sheets.",
    "To make topping, break eggs into flour and mix well to remove lumps. Whisk in milk, pour into a saucepan and bring to the boil, whisking until smooth and thickened. Add pepper, pour over top of lasagne and sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown.",
    "Serves 6."
