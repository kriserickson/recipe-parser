    "Cut each of the bananas into three equal pieces. Gently slide the popsicle sticks through the center. Place the bananas on a parchment-lined sheet pan and stick them in the freezer until very cold, about 30 minutes.",
    "In the meantime, Pulse the peanuts in the food processor until finely chopped. Alternatively, you can chop by hand. Place them in a shallow dish.",
    "Melt the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl in 30 second intervals. Add the peanut butter and stir to combine. Transfer the chocolate mixture to a tall glass.",
    "Remove the bananas from the freezer and one by one dip in the chocolate, allowing the mixture to move up the sides of the glass. Roll the top half of the banana in the peanuts and return the finished bananas to the parchment-lined sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining bananas and return to the freezer for 2 hours or overnight."
