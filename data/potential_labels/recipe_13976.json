    "Heat a medium pot over medium heat. Add the olive oil followed by the minced shallot. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the shallot is fragrant and translucent. Add the rest of the ingredients, through the smoked salt. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. The beans should be hot and the sauce thick. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of water as needed. Taste and add a pinch more smoked salt as needed.",
    "Divide the polenta into four bowls and top with the smoky beans, chopped scallion greens, and a grind or two of black pepper."
