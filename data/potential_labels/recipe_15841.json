    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. and place the cored, halved pears cut-side up in an 11 x 7 or similar size baking dish. Brush the cut-side of the pears with a teaspoon or so of maple syrup and pour the apple/pear juice into the bottom of the dish.",
    "Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes or until the pears are tender.",
    "While the pears bake make the oatmeal. Bring the water or milk to a boil in a small saucepan then add in the oats and salt. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes stirring occasionally.",
    "Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the cinnamon, ginger, 4 teaspoons of maple syrup and almond extract. Cover with the lid until the pears have finished baking.",
    "When the pears are ready divide the oatmeal among them then place back in the oven uncovered for another 5 minutes.",
    "Mix together all of the ingredients for the yogurt topping, minus the nuts.",
