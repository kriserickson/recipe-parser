    "Instructions",
    "Start by draining the tofu. Let it rest on a towel or paper towel for a few minutes. Lightly press to remove as much liquid from the tofu as possible.",
    "Cut the tofu into 1″ cubes.",
    "In a small bowl, combine sesame seeds and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and toss in the tofu cubes to coat on all sides.",
    "Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat (we prefer to use our cast iron skillet for this). Add the tofu and sear on each side until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.",
    "Remove the tofu and place on a paper towel lined plate.",
    "Over medium heat, sauté the onion and carrot until slightly tender then add garlic and broccoli.",
    "Add vegetable broth and seasonings and cook until the broccoli is tender – about 5 minutes",
    "Remove the vegetable mixture from the skillet and set aside in a bowl.",
    "Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, tamari, and coconut sugar and stir until the sauce reduces and becomes syrupy.",
    "Return the broccoli mixture and tofu to the skillet with the sauce and stir to combine. Cook for 5-7 minutes until broccoli reaches desired tenderness.",
    "Garnish with sesame seeds and finely chopped green onion."
