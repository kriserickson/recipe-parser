    "Trim and large-dice pork loin. Heat a large Dutch oven or wide skillet over medium-high heat, add oil and brown meat lightly for 5 to 10 minutes. Add coriander, cumin, ginger, cayenne, salt, black pepper, green pepper, olives, and shallots to the pot. Reduce heat to low and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, without browning shallots. Add preserved lemon and stock. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add plums and simmer until sauce has thickened, adding more salt, if desired. Roughly chop cilantro and add just before serving."
