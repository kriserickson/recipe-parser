    "PREPARATION",
    "Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine spinach with butter, onion, eggs, cheeses, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and panko. Mix well.",
    "Roll mixture into 1½-inch balls; place onto prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate for 20 minutes, while oven is preheating.Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden and piping hot. Serve hot or at room temperature.",
    "NOTE A quick way to thaw frozen spinach is to microwave it in a glass bowl, covered, on high power, for 3 minutes.",
    "VARIATION Instead of mozzarella, use Swiss or Cheddar cheese. If you like gooier bites, then double up on the shredded cheese. As a Passover option, use Passover panko, matzo meal, or cracker crumbs.",
    "TIP Freeze with ease. Mix and shape in advance, then freeze in a single layer. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag. When needed, bake frozen, adding 3-4 minutes to the baking time."
