    "Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat, parchment paper, or non stick foil.",
    "Put the white chocolate in a glass microwave safe bowl and heat on 50% power for a minute. Keep heating, checking, and stirring until the chocolate is melted. If you are using chips they won't look melted until you stir them.",
    "When the chocolate is melted and smooth, add in the almonds and quickly spread out the mixture on the lined baking sheet.",
    "Dust the warm chocolate with sea salt, being careful to get it evenly distributed across the bark.",
    "Set the pan in the refrigerator to cool until fully set, at least an hour.",
    "Break apart the bark into whatever size pieces you choose.",
    "Try not to eat it all before you can give some of it away."
