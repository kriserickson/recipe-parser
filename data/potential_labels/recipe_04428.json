    "Once the falafel mixture is ready, mix the courgette in thoroughly and pour into a well-greased loaf tin. Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes. For the first twenty minutes, cover with foil to prevent it browning too quickly â€“ remove this 2/3 of the way through to allow it to turn golden brown.",
    "While the loaf is baking, heat the olive oil over a medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook until it begins to soften. Add the baby corn, mange tout, and mushrooms and cook for two minutes. Add the garlic and cumin, stirring well. Pour in the tomatoes, add both types of paprika and the chilli. Simmer for around ten minutes. Add the chickpeas, courgette and black pepper, simmer for a further five minutes.",
    "Coat the lettuce leaves in the lime juice and sprinkle over the seeds to serve. Check the loaf is cooked by inserting a cocktail stick or skewer; when it comes out clean the loaf is cooked through. Once ready, turn out onto a wire cooling rack and cut into thick slices. Serve with the salad and chili."
