    "HOW TO MAKE IT",
    "Pre-heat oven to 400° F. Clean and core mushrooms. Set on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cored side down, and place in the oven for ten minutes.",
    "While the mushrooms cook, sauté the chorizo in a small non-stick pan on medium heat for 5 minutes. Add in 2 tsp. of cornstarch and continue to cook another 5 minutes, breaking up with a spatula. Once you finish cooking the chorizo, place it in a strainer for 5 minutes, pressing to remove all excess fat.",
    "In the same sauté pan you used to cook the chorizo, melt 1 Tbsp. of butter, and sauté the garlic, shallot, jalapeno, salt and pepper for about 5 minutes. Once they are done, combine in a small mixing bowl with panko, chorizo, and cheese. Mix well.",
    "Turn the mushrooms back over so that the hollow side is facing up. Stuff each mushroom with the chorizo mixture, about 1 Tbsp. in each. Place the mushrooms back into the oven for 15-20 minutes, until golden. Enjoy"
