    "-melt the butter in a sauce pan over medium heat and then stir in the peanut butter, graham cracker crumbs and sugar. when it’s melted/mixed, spoon the mixture into the muffin tins. you can play around with the peanut butter to chocolate ratio. i prefer more peanut butter with a thin layer of chocolate, and lou prefers them to be equally peanut butter and chocolate. we’re so complex.",
    "-in a separate pan combine the chocolate and milk. stir over medium heat until the chocolate has melted.",
    "-spoon the chocolate over the peanut butter, filling the papers almost to the top.",
    "-sprinkle with sea salt and then refrigerate *if you are using the mini muffin tin, i recommend sticking the first batch into the freezer for 10 minutes or so to get them to harden up so that you can remove them and make another batch. i also melted a little more chocolate/milk to satisfy lou’s ratio preference. ok, i doubled the chocolate. he made me.",
    "-there are two schools of thought on how these are best eaten: 1. taken from the refrigerator one at a time, thawed and savored- a classy approach 2. eaten straight from the freezer by the handful, with the occassional bit of wrapper stuck to the cup {mine}."
