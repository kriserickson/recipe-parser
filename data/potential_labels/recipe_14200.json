    "In a medium saucepan, place the tomatillos, chile de arbol and garlic clove. If you are unsure of how much heat you want, add 2 chiles de arbol. Cover generously with water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until thoroughly cooked and tomatillos are mushy, but not coming apart.",
    "Transfer the tomatillos, garlic and 1 chile de arbol to a blender. Add the cilantro, onion and salt. Puree until smooth. Taste for salt and adjust if need be. If you want more heat, add the second chile de arbol."
