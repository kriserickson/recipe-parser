    "Unless you’re as quick as a Chef with a knife, I recommend chopping your vegetables first. Start with your chili, remove the stem, split in half and slice thinly lengthwise, then width wise into tiny cubes. Wash and cop the parsley quite finely. Have your garlic cloves peeled and ready to mince.",
    "In a frying pan on high heat, add a drizzle of olive oil, enough to just coat the bottom. Once the oil is hot, add the shrimps to sear on each side. You don’t want to cook them, just slightly sear them.",
    "Add the chili, minced garlic and butter. Mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Add a squeeze of lemon juice plus the white wine, mix well and remove the shrimps (prawns) and set aside.",
    "Add the cream and on full heat, let it reduce until thicker on the outside. Add the chopped parsley and return the shrimps (prawns), mix well and serve over hot rice."
