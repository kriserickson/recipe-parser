    "Add olive oil to a frying pan over medium-high heat and add chickpeas. Season with paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, cumin, and salt, and sauté until slightly browned — about 5 minutes. Set chickpeas aside.",
    "In the same pan, cook your ghee over medium-high heat and add the pumpkin. Season and sauté just like before. The pumpkin takes a bit longer to soften and caramelize — about 10 to 12 minutes. Once it's done, set it aside as well.",
    "In a small bowl, add the tahini, water, lemon juice, vinegar, paprika, garlic, and salt, and mix well until you have a dressing.",
    "In a large bowl, add the kale or any leafy greens of choice. Top with the chickpeas, pumpkin, avocado, cilantro/coriander, black seeds, and dressing.",
    "Massage it all together with your hands to really break down the kale and get it seasoned evenly. Serve and enjoy!"
