    "In a medium bowl, combine the beans and cooked quinoa with the remainder of the ingredients.",
    "Using (clean) hands or a fork, thoroughly mix the ingredients together, mashing the beans as you go. This should form a paste-like mixture that is easy to form into patties.",
    "Divide the mixture into four equal balls, and form each into a patty between 1/4 and 1/2 an inch thick.",
    "In a medium saucepan over high eat, cook the patties in 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil for 1 minute on each side, or until lightly browned.",
    "Transfer the saucepan to a 400 degrees oven and bake for 15 minutes.",
    "Serve on a whole-grain bun or \"Greatist style\" over fresh greens with your choice of fixings on top! Our favorite? A thick slice of tomato, fresh lettuce, and avocado slices dusted with paprika! (A little melted cheddar never hurts, either.)"
