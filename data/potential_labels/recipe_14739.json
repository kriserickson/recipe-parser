    "Take the pork out of the fridge 1 hour before cooking. Generously salt and pepper each side.",
    "Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven until quite hot, over medium-high heat. Sear each loin for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until they are golden brown. Remove the pork to a plate.",
    "Deglaze the Dutch oven with the cider and the Cognac, making sure to scrape up all the brown bits. Add the brown sugar, and then let the cider reduce by half, about 10 minutes.",
    "Add the onion and then the leek, and let them simmer away for about 5 minutes. Add the apple to the pot, and incorporate. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Toss in two sprigs of thyme, and then settle the pork loins on top of the onion, leek, and apple. Cover the Dutch oven with its lid completely, and cook for 20 minutes, or until the pork loin is just cooked through. Let the pork rest for 10 minutes before slicing it."
