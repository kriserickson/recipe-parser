    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
    "In a large Dutch oven*, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat until hot, but not smoking. Add broccoli in one layer. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until the broccoli is nicely caramelized. Season both sides with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. Remove the broccoli and set it aside.",
    "Reduce heat to medium; add in onion and butter. Cook onion, stirring frequently until softened and transparent. Stir in flour with a wooden spoon. Cook until flour mixture is a light brown (blonde) color, stirring constantly. Switch to a whisk and whisk in milk 1/4 cup at a time, waiting for the milk to thicken before adding more.",
    "Once the sauce is thickened and all milk has been added, remove from heat and gently stir in pasta, broccoli, 2 cups of cheese and peas.",
    "In a small bowl mix together breadcrumbs, remaining cheddar, remaining oil and parsley. Top the pasta with the breadcrumbs. Bake for 30 minutes, or until breadcrumbs are golden brown.",
    "Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving.",
    "*If you donâ€™t have a Dutch oven, you can use a large skillet or a pasta pot, and then transfer to a 9 x 13-inch baking dish for baking."
