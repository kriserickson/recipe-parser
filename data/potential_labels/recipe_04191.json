    "Prepare a lined baking dish with parchment paper. _You can use foil as well.",
    "Fill a sauce pan with 1 inch of water and place on stove top over low heat. Finely chop the almond bark and place in glass bowl (or heat resistant bowl). Set on top of sauce pan to heat chocolate. As chocolate melts, continually stir to ensure a smooth chocolate and no lumps are left. You can also melt in the microwave on 50% power, stirring every 20-30 seconds; as well as using a double broiler.",
    "Once chocolate is completely melted, whisk in cake mix.",
    "Hold a rod by one end and dip it in the chocolate, leaving an inch or two uncovered. I ended up twisting the rod as I removed it from the chocolate to make it smooth.",

    "Place the pretzels in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to set the chocolate."
