    "In a zip-top bag, combine marinade ingredients with steak. Set aside at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, or in the fridge for at least 1 hour, and up to 10 hours.",
    "When steak is finished marinating, remove from marinade and gently wipe off excess marinade. Set aside to come to room temperature. Meanwhile, preheat a grill pan, grill or large cast iron skillet over high heat.",
    "Once pan is hot, almost to the point of smoking, add steak to the pan and sear on each side for 4 to 5 minutes (this is for medium rare, for medium: 6 to 7, medium well: 7 to 8). Using a meat thermometer, check the temperature before you remove steak. It should read between 128 and 132 degrees F (the steak will continue to cook even after you remove it from the pan).",
    "Remove steak from the pan set it aside to rest for at least 5 to 6 minutes. Make sure to rest it on a surface that will catch all the juices released during the resting process.",
    "While the steak is resting, assemble the salad ingredients in a large bowl or platter, or plate individually. In a small bowl, mix together all the spicy crema ingredients.",
    "Once the steak has rested, thinly slice it against the grain, and place it on top of the salad. Drizzle the whole salad with crema and serve immediately."
