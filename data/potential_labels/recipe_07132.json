    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees, and rinse off your black beans and allow to dry while getting the flax egg ready.",
    "Prepare 2 large flax eggs, 1 tbsp ground flax meal with 2.5 tbsp water for each egg. I put this directly in the food processor and let sit for a few minutes to thicken.",
    "Add the rest of the ingredients to the food processor and blend. I added a few tbsp of water after this to make sure the mix wasn't too thick, but you also don't want this to be too runny.",
    "Place either in oiled muffin tins for round brownies or a baking dish to make square brownies. Top with vegan chocolate chips.",
    "Bake for roughly 20-25 minutes. Around 22 minutes I turned the heat off and let them sit in the oven for another 3 minutes, then took them out.",
    "Let the brownies cool completely before adding almond butter on top or other toppings.",
