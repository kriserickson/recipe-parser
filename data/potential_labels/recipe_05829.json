    "Peel and dice mangos then place in the bowl of a food processor or blender.",
    "Get every last drop of juice out of lime and add it to the mango along with the Habanero. Process until well pureed and almost a juice.",
    "Add garlic, Achiote paste, Mexican oregano, Allspice berries, cumin seeds, black pepper, salt, sugar, vinegar and water. Process until blended.",
    "Pour marinade into a large bowl or glass baking dish.",
    "Submerge the pork chops in the marinade but, leave the bones above the surface. Marinate 4 to 6 hours. Turn the chops occasionally.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the Spiced Mango Puree.",
    "Remove the chops from the marinade and bring to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Cover the bones with tin foil.",
    "Prepare a gas or charcoal grill to medium heat. Place the chops on the grill and spoon a little of the marinade on top of the chops. Discard the rest of the marinade. Cook the chops for 7 to 8 on the first side. Turn the chops and watch the temperature carefully, they may not need to cook quite as long on the second side. The chops can be slightly pink in the center or cooked all the way through but still juicy. It is recommended to remove the chops from the grill at 160 degrees and allow them to rest. They will continue to cook for a few minutes after they are removed from the grill. Be careful not to dry them out.",
    "Serve with Spicy Mango Puree.",
    "For Puree:",
    "Peel mango and place in a blender or food processor with lime juice and Habanero, puree until smooth but, still has texture.",
    "Add garlic, Allspice, Achiote paste, black pepper, cumin, Mexican oregano, salt and vinegar. Process until well mixed.",
    "Cover and chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve the chops then remove and allow to come to room temperature, about 45 minutes."
