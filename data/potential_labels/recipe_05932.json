    "In a large skillet, start by making a roux. Instead of using bacon fat, melt your butter over medium-low heat and add your flour, whisking constantly until smooth and a deep golden amber color (around 10-15 minutes). Remove from heat and keep whisking until cool.",
    "Mix vegetables (onion, pepper, celery and garlic), chicken and sausage into the roux and return to a simmer. Cook for 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Remove from heat.",
    "Bring chicken broth and water to a boil in a heavy stockpot and whisk in roux/vegetable/meat mixture. Reduce to a simmer and add okra, salt and pepper, thyme, oregano, cayenne, bay leaves, Cajun and Old Bay seasoning. Cover and cook for 30 minutes.",
    "Stir in rice, cover and cook for another 30 minutes.",
    "Add the shrimp and simmer until shrimp is opaque, another 10 minutes. (Chicken and sausage should be cooked through and rice tender.)",
    "Remove bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, and/or hot sauce.",
