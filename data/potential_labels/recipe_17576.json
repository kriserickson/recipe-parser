    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "Toss the butternut squash with coconut oil, cinnamon, paprika and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes. Stir the squash around a few times so it cooks evenly.",
    "While squash is cooking, add quinoa and vegetable broth to a sauce pan. Bring to a boil, cover and turn down to simmer for 10 - 15 minutes. The quinoa should be soft, but there should still be some liquid in the pot.",
    "Remove squash from the oven, transfer to a bowl and mash it with a fork until almost smooth. Add squash to the quinoa, stirring to combine.",
    "Sprinkle in nutritional yeast (or cheese) and cook for another 1 - 2 minutes.",
    "Serve immediately and garnish with additional nutritional yeast (or cheese) and a drizzle of honey."
