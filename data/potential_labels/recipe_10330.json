    "Heat the oil in a large frying pan, cook the lamb until browned all over for about 10 mins, then remove from the pan. Cook the onion in the same pan until golden brown, about 5 mins. Stir through the ginger, garlic, cumin and coriander, then cook for 2 mins more until you smell the spices. Return the lamb to the pan, pour over the tomatoes, bring to the boil, then leave to simmer over a gentle heat for 11‚ÅÑ2 hrs until the meat is really tender. Top up with a little boiling water if the sauce becomes too dry. Add in the chickpeas and garam masala, then simmer for 5 mins more. Stir through spinach and cook until wilted slightly then season to taste."
