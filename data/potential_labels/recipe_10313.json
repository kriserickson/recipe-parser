    "Heat 4-inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer reaches 375Â°F.. Drain potatoes and dry them thoroughly with paper towels. Fry the potatoes in small batches until they are crisp and golden, about 3 minutes per batch. Drain chips on paper towels then toss them in a large bowl with the Old Bay."
