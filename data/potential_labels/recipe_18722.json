    "Place the currants in a small bowl. Splash in some vinegar (maybe a teaspoon) and then cover with hot tap water — about a tablespoon. Set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the fennel, fronds, asparagus or snap peas, onion, and parsley. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss. Add the olive oil and fresh lemon juice and toss again. Taste. If it’s too tart, add more olive oil by the tablespoon till it tastes right. If it needs more dressing, add more olive oil and lemon to taste. If it’s not tart enough, add more lemon (or a splash of vinegar).",
    "Drain the currants and add to the bowl. Add the avocado, and toss again. Shave in Parmigiano-Reggiano to taste. Toss. Taste. Adjust seasonings as necessary, and serve."
