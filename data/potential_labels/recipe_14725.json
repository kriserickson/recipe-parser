    "Directions",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Blend together flour, seasoned salt, cayenne pepper and ground black pepper. Cut wings and dredge them in the flour. Heat oil to 350 degrees. Fry wings for about 5 to 7 minutes, and then drain on a wire rack. Depending upon the side of your pot fry 5 or 6 wings at a time. Be sure to stir the wings once during cooking to make sure that the wings cook evening. Cook the wings until they just begin to brown. Bake wings for about 15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.",
    "Prepare the sauce by heating together in small pot, the Franks Red Hot Sauce, butter, white vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Whisk the sauce together when the butter has melted. Pour wings into a large bowl, and drizzle the sauce over. Turn the wings over in the sauce until they are fully coated.",
    "Serve immediately with celery stalks and plenty of blue cheese dressing"
