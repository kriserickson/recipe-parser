    "Add the oats, egg and milk to a large mixing bowl. Mix together and set aside for 10 minutes.",
    "Add ground turkey, ginger, curry paste, fish sauce, sugar, cilantro, salt, garlic and green onions. Mix to combine.",
    "Scoop the meat mixture into balls, a little smaller than golf-ball size.",
    "In a large nonstick skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.",
    "When the oil is hot, place one layer of meatballs in the pan, leaving space between each-- I usually cook them in a few batches.",
    "Brown the meatballs, turning occasionally as they cook, until all sides are browned. They don't need to be cooked through, just browned on all sides.",
    "Remove the meatballs to a plate once they are browned. Use a paper towel to blot out any grease from the pan, without removing the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.",
    "Add coconut milk to the pan, scraping up those browned bits as your stir. Add green curry paste, brown sugar and garlic, stirring to combine.",
    "Add the meatballs back to the skillet. Simmer them in the sauce until cooked through, about 7-10 minutes.",
    "Stir in the lime juice. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve over hot, cooked rice."
