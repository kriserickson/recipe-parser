    "DIRECTIONS:",
    "Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a8L casserole dish or 9×13” pan with cooking spray.",
    "Pour the cherry and blueberry pie fillings in the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle the nuts over the fruit. Open the cake mix and sprinkle the power evenly over the top.",
    "Slice butter into small pieces and sprinkle evenly over the top of the cake mix. Make sure to make it even so that it all melts into the cake mix.",
    "Bake for 30-40 minutes until the fruit starts to bubble up around the edges and the edges start to turn golden. I baked mine in a casserole dish that was deeper than a 9×13” pan so it took 40 minutes. Different pans will have different baking times, so start checking after 30 minutes.",
    "Serve with ice cream or whipped cream. Store covered in refrigerator."
