    "Add all ingredients except the goat cheese and parsley (and any additional salt and pepper) to a large, heavy pot – I use a 7-quart dutch oven.",
    "Place the pot over high heat and bring to a rolling boil. As soon as it comes to the rolling boil, set the timer for 9 minutes. Stir and toss with tongs as it cooks, stirring frequently for the first few minutes and then constantly as it thickens and begins to stick to the bottom of the pot. When the 9 minutes is up, the pasta should be tender and the sauce will have thickened slightly. If the pasta is not yet cooked, continue for one more minute. Remove from heat.",
    "Crumble goat cheese into the pasta. Stir gently until melted and combined. Let sit for 5 minutes (at this point, the pasta will seem somewhat soupy, but it will thicken as it sits).",
    "Stir and taste. Add additional salt and pepper if desired.",
    "Divide between bowls and sprinkle parsley over the tops."
