    "Preheat oven to 375Â°F.",
    "Place the spareribs in a heavy pot with half the onion, half the minced garlic, and the thyme sprigs.",
    "Cover with a lid or foil and bake for 1 1/2 hours.",
    "Remove the ribs; set aside.",
    "In the same pot, over medium heat, brown the bacon.",
    "Remove all but about 2 tablespoons of the fat and add the celery, carrot, salt, pepper, thyme leaves, and the remaining onion and garlic (minced and whole) and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "Add the broth, wine, tomatoes, bay leaves, and beans. Bring to a simmer, then add the cooked ribs.",
    "Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the olive oil, bread crumbs, and parsley.",
    "Sprinkle the bread-crumb mixture over the cassoulet and bake for 1 hour, uncovered, occasionally pressing the bread crumbs into the cassoulet to thicken it.",
    "Let cool and serve.",
    "TIP To get a jump start on a weeknight dinner, complete steps 1 to 7 of the cassoulet recipe on Sunday and store, covered, on the stove for a day or in the fridge for up to 3 days. Then simply add the bread-crumb mixture and bake for 1 hour."
