    "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. In a plate, combine the flour, salt and pepper and dredge the chicken breasts in the mixture on both sides. Cook the chicken breasts on both sides (about 7 minutes each) until lightly brown. Do not worry if the chicken isn't cooked through; it will cook with the balsamic vinegar sauce.",
    "Heat the remaining ½ tablespoon olive oil in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Sauté the onion and mushroom until softened but not golden, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Cover with the chicken broth, balsamic vinegar and dried thyme. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce thickens.",
    "Pour the balsamic vinegar sauce over the chicken breasts. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and tender."
