    "When the onion and garlic are starting to brown, add the potato cubes, smoked tofu and paprika powder and give it a good mix.",
    "Let it roast for about 2-3 minutes, then add 2 1/2 cups (500ml) of water.",
    "Let it cook without the lid on for about 30-45 minutes on medium-high heat, the water will reduce itself. If the goulash is getting too thick, you can add more water again until the potatoes are soft & the goulash has reached the preferred consistency.",
    "Add the salt, dried marjoram & tomato paste and stir until the tomato paste dissolves.",
    "Add more salt to taste & enjoy for example with some homemade bread."
