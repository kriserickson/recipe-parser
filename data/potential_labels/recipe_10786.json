    "In a medium mixing bowl, combine all ingredients and mix together with a rubber spatula. Or combine in a food processor. Scrape the butter onto a long sheet of wax paper, forming a straight line. Fold the end of the paper over the butter and roll into an even cylinder, about the diameter of a silver dollar. Twist each end and place in the refrigerator until solid, about 2 hours."
