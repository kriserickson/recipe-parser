    "Preheat oven to 425°. In a medium saucepan, warm vegetable stock over low heat.",
    "In a small Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add sun-dried tomatoes with oil, garlic, onions, salt, and pepper. Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon. Add the rice and wine and stir until wine is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Reduce to low heat and ladle 3 cups warm stock in 1 cup increments; continuously stir until rice absorbs most of the liquid, 5 to 7 minutes.",
    "Stir in last 2 cups of stock and place lid on Dutch oven. Bake for 15 minutes.",
    "Remove from oven. Stir in cheese and butter until creamy. If the risotto is too thick, add in a splash of stock. Garnish with basil and serve immediately."
