    "Preheat oven to 425°F. Bring broth to a boil in a saucepan. Add the potato, carrot, onion, and thyme and simmer the mixture for 15 minutes or until vegetables are soft. Stir the flour mixture slowly into the vegetables and simmer, stirring until it is thick. Remove the pan from heat, stir in chicken and peas. Add pot pie filling to 4 ramekins or 1 9-inch pie plate. Cover with pie crust (cut in to quartered pieces if you’re making minis), cut a few slits in the surface, and bake for 15-20 minutes (for minis) or 25-30 for a regular 9-incher."
