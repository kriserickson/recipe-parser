    "Peel the garlic and ginger. Grate the ginger across a small holed cheese grater straight into a blender to catch the juices (the garlic can go in whole).",
    "Add all of the rest of the ingredients to the blender. Blend the mixture until smooth. Taste and adjust the salt by adding more soy sauce, the sweetness by adding more honey, or the acidity by adding more vinegar. Refrigerate until ready to eat. Keep refrigerated for up to one week."
