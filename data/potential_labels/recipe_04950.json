    "Add your baked tofu (or whatever chicken substitute you are using) at this point, and allow it to simmer for another 30 minutes. Towards the end, you can add 1 or 2 tablespoons of ice water to the mixture once or twice, to get the beautiful reddish walnut oil to rise to the top for presentation purposes. This step is totally optional.",

    "Ingredients:",
    "2 cups fresh raw walnuts",
    "1 medium white onion, grated",
    "¼ cup pomegranate paste*",
    "3 TB tomato paste",
    "2 – 3 cups water",
    "1 tsp turmeric",
    "½ - 1 tsp cinnamon",
    "salt and pepper to taste",
    "1 cup of your favorite vegan chicken (I used baked tofu, but seitan, tempeh, packaged faux chicken, or even legumes such as lima beans also work well)",
    "Directions:",
    "Using a food processor, grind the walnuts until they form a paste with a smooth nut-butter consistency",
    "Crumble the walnut paste, along with the grated onion, the pomegranate and tomato pastes, and spices into a stock pot over medium-high heat, and stir in enough water until smooth. You want a thin consistency, like tomato juice, this will thicken up substantially. Make sure to get rid of any lumps in the sauce.",
    "Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for about an hour, stirring occasionally. As the mixture thickens, the color will darken to a deep brown."
