    "Pre-heat the oven to 180C/160C fan.",
    "Using a food processor, blitz the biscuits to fine crumbs, tip into a bowl and mix in the melted butter until fully combined. Press the mixture into a lined 24cm loose-bottomed cake tin, press down with the bottom of a glass to compact. Chill in the fridge while you make the filling.",
    "Mix the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla seeds and eggs in a bowl until you have a smooth mixture. Pour this mixture into the cake tin, place the tin onto an oven tray and bake in the oven for around 50-55 minutes. The centre should have a slight wobble. Leave to go cold before carefully removing the side of the tin. Leave the cheesecake on the tin base and chill in the fridge. Once chilled, carefully slide from the tin onto a serving plate.",
    "Meanwhile, cut the fruit into wedges and put in a saucepan with the honey, vanilla pod and bay leaf. Gently heat so that the fruit softens but holds its shape. Leave to stand in the honey until you’re ready to serve.",
    "Serve the cheesecake with the fruit and honey drizzled over the top."
