    "A look around this weekend’s farmers’ market showed the time is now to get on the Meatball and String Beans wagon: beans are plentiful and cheap, and they’re practically giving away bags of cosmetically imperfect plum tomatoes.",
    "This dish is the definition of a G.R.O.A.T.: simple, comforting, and dependable. Also: Who doesn’t like meatballs?"

    "First: Make meatballs. We made ‘em pretty standard Italian-style. Use a pound or so of mixed meats (we always bought “meatball mix” made from veal/beef/pork, a pound for every two people), an egg, grated Parm, some breadcrumbs—likely “seasoned”. Mix. Roll.",
    "Meanwhile, make a sauce: one big onion, a clove of minced garlic, a green pepper (optional!), all sautéed. Add salt and white pepper. Maybe some crushed dried chile flakes. Then add about five pounds of peeled (not optional!) and chopped plum tomatoes. Cook on medium-high for a bit, then bring down to a simmer, add meatballs, partially cover. Cook for 30 minutes.",
    "Add a few handfuls of trimmed string beans to the sauce and simmer until tender but not falling apart. That’s it. Serve in a bowl with crusty bread. You’re done."
