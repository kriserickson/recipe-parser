    "Instructions",
    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "Mix lemon juice, olive oil, and melted butter in a shallow bowl. Set aside",
    "In another shallow bowl, mix all-purpose flour, spices, salt and pepper. Set next to the lemon juice mixture.",
    "Pat fish fillet dry. Dip fish in the lemon juice mixture then dip in the flour mixture. Shake off excess flour.",
    "Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat (watch the oil to be sure it is sizzling but not smoking). Add fish and sear on each side to give it some color, but do not fully cook (about a couple minutes on each side) Remove from heat.",
    "To the remaining lemon juice mixture, add the minced garlic and mix. Drizzle all over the fish fillets.",
    "Bake in the heated oven for until it begins to flake easily with a fork (10 minutes should do it, but begin checking earlier). Remove from heat and sprinkle chopped parsley.",
    "Serving suggestions: Serve immediately with Lebanese rice and this Mediterranean chickpea salad or this traditional Greek salad.",
    "Notes",
    "This recipe has been edited adding step #5 to achieve more color and a more crispy texture."
