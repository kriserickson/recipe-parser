    "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly grease and flour one bread pan.",
    "In a bowl, stir together the Greek yogurt, vanilla extract (scale depending on love for vanilla flavor - I like it strong), 1 large egg, coconut oil (measured when melted), and honey.",
    "In a small bowl, mash the banana really well. The banana is very important for binding of the bread and a lower calorie sweetening. The more ripe - the better.",
    "Stir in the banana and brown sugar.",
    "In a separate bowl, stir together the oat flour (measured AFTER blending. I used regular old fashioned or quick oats and quickly pulse them in a blender or food processor until they resemble flour. Then measure and add to the bowl), white or white-whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.",
    "Add the dry to the wet and mix until just combined. Over-mixing will result in dense bread.",
    "Stir in the grated zucchini (make sure you have thoroughly dried the zucchini to keep it from being too wet/watery in the finished bread) and chocolate chips if desired.",
    "Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and top with more chocolate chips if desired.",
    "Bake for 40-50 minutes or until a toothpick when inserted into the center comes out clean and the bread has begun to slightly pull away from the sides. Barely under-cooking the bread will yield a softer and slightly denser bread. (I pulled mine out at 43 minutes.)",
    "If needed tent some tin foil over the top to keep the top from over-cooking."
