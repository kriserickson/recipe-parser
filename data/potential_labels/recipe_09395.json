    "Line an 8x8\" square baking pan with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Set aside.",
    "Place a saute pan with about 2 inches of water over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Place 1 cup of the chocolate chips into a heat proof bowl with 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and ½ of the can of sweetened condensed milk. Place into the pan of simmering water and reduce heat to low (this is your double boiler). Stir the chocolate mixture with a rubber scraper until smooth, then add ¼ cup of the chopped peanuts and stir until combined. Pour the chocolate mixture into the prepared pan and spread evenly.",
    "Place the peanut butter and remaining coconut oil in a microwaveable bowl and microwave for 30 seconds or until melted. Stir to combine, then stir in the remaining sweetened condensed milk. Pour over the chocolate layer and spread evenly.",
    "Press the remaining ½ cup chocolate chips and ¼ cup of chopped peanuts into the top, and chill for a minimum of 2 hours or until set.",
    "Once chilled, lift the fudge out of the pan and remove the foil. Place on a cutting board and cut into squares. Serve and enjoy!"
