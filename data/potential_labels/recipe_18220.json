    "In a food processor, combine the flour, freeze-dried strawberries, sugar, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Pulse until the strawberries are fully incorporated into the flour.",
    "Add the butter and pulse until it breaks down into pea-sized pieces. Do not over-mix.",
    "Add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing between each addition, until the dough just holds together.",
    "Transfer the dough to a clean work surface and divide into 2 discs, one slightly larger than the other. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.",
    "In a medium pot over medium heat, combine the sliced strawberries, lemon curd, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a light boil, stirring occasionally.",
    "Add the cornstarch slurry and simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until the filling thickens. Remove from the heat and let cool.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).",
    "Remove the larger disc of dough from the fridge and sprinkle with flour. Roll out to about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick and transfer to a greased 9½-inch (24-cm) pie dish, pressing down to form the bottom crust. Cut off any excess dough around the edges and set aside. Chill the bottom crust while you roll out the top.",
    "Roll out the smaller dough disc. Cut 6 1-inch-wide (2-cm) strips from the dough and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Combine all of the excess dough, re-roll it, and use a cookie cutter to cut out shapes of your choosing. Add to the baking sheet and chill the strips and shapes for 5 minutes.",
    "Remove the bottom crust from the fridge and poke holes all over the bottom with a fork. Pour the strawberry filling into the crust.",
    "Lay 3 of the dough strips vertically and evenly spaced across the top of the pie, and lay the other 3 horizontally. Place a cutout shape at the intersection of every vertical and horizontal strip. Trim the edges of the dough, then crimp with a fork all the way around.",
    "Brush the crust with the beaten egg, then sprinkle with turbinado sugar.",
    "Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.",
    "Let cool, then chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.",
    "Enjoy!"
