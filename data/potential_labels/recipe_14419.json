    "Directions:",
    "1.) Preheat the oven to 425° F and line two baking sheets with foil. Toss the fries with the oil and seasonings and toss well until evenly coated. Lay out in a single layer on the sheet pans, making sure each fry has it’s own space and isn’t touching any other. This helps all the sides brown evenly while the cook.",
    "2.) Place the sheet pans in the oven and bake for about 20 minutes, then rotate the pans and cook for the remaining time, until golden brown and crispy. Serve immediately with your protein and vegetables of choice."
