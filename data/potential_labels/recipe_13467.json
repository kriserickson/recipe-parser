    "Preheat over to 400 degrees. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Spray skillet with nonstick spray and add 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Once hot, add eggplant and onion. Add pepper and salt, if needed. Reduce heat to medium low and let cook through, about 7 minutes. Toast three slices of bread in a toaster. Toast on a higher setting than normal as these will be bread crumbs. In a medium bowl, grate the Babybel cheese. Once toast is ready, crumble each slice into the bowl. Add eggplant mixture once it is cooked through. Add Italian seasoning, onion powder and Parmesan cheese then add chicken stock. Do not over moisten mixture, however, make sure it is moist. With a wet towel, wipe off mushroom caps and remove stems. Place on a cookie sheet, gill side up. Add remaining olive oil to cover each cap. Stuff with stuffing and place in oven for 20-25 minutes."
