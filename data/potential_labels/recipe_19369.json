    "Cook the rice according to package instructions.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.",
    "While the rice is cooking, cook the ground beef or turkey in a saucepan until browned. Add the taco seasoning packets and water; cook and stir. Drain the black beans and add to the cooked beef. Stir in the 10 oz can of enchilada sauce, followed by the cooked rice.",
    "Spoon about ⅓ cup of the meat mixture into the tortilla wraps and sprinkle with approximately a tablespoon of cheese. Roll up and place into a 9×13” greased baking dish. You’ll probably need (2) 9×13” pans OR 1 9×13” pan and a square 9×9” baking dish to fit all your enchiladas.",
    "Once the enchiladas are rolled up, open the remaining 19oz can of enchilada sauce and pour evenly over the enchiladas. Sprinkle more shredded cheese over the top.",
    "Bake, uncovered, for about 20 minutes or until cooked through. Serve warm."
