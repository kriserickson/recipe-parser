    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8 x 8 brownie tray.",
    "Stir 2 tbs of gelatin into a 1/4 cup of cool/cold water and let sit for about 5 minutes until all the water is absorbed, and the mixture is an opaque gel.",
    "Stir in the 1/4 cup of hot/near-boiling water. The mixture should now be a thick, slightly brownish liquid. Stay the course - this will be good.",
    "Thoroughly stir in the 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and stevia.",
    "Next, stir in the coconut manna until completely combined.",
    "Likewise, mix in the peanut butter thoroughly.",
    "Pour the batter into the prepared brownie pan and bake for 25 minutes, until the top is completely cooked.",
    "This is important - chill in the fridge for about 2 hours, or in the freezer for 15-20 minutes (guess what I did...) until the brownies are hard. They will fall apart when you cut them, otherwise!",
    "Next, cut into eight equal pieces and enjoy."
