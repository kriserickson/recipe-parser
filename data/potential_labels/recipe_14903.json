    "1 Prep the artichokes. Prepare a large bowl of water, squeeze half a lemon into the water. Working with the artichokes one at a time, pull off the outer leaves of the artichoke until they easily snap off. Peel the stem, and cut off all but 1 to 1 1/2 inches of the stem. Cut off the top half of the artichokes.",
    "Use a paring knife to cut around the edge of the artichoke, removing any green parts. Angle the knife toward the center of the artichoke while you do this so the result is more cone-shaped.",
    "Use a melon baller to scoop out and discard the fuzzy choke in the center of the artichoke. Cut the artichoke into quarters, and cut each quarter into 3 or 4 slices. Place in the acidified water.",
    "2 Heat olive oil in a 3 to 4 quart, thick-bottomed pot on medium heat. Add the sliced onions and artichoke hearts. Toss to coat with the olive oil. Cook on medium low to low heat for 40 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, until the artichokes are completely cooked through and tender, and the onions are caramelized.",
    "3 Sprinkle with salt, sugar, and vinegar and cook for a few minutes more."
