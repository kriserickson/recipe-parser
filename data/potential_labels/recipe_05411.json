    "Slice the jalape単os into rounds as thin as you like, I normally do 1/4 inch. Test the jalape単os and remove the seeds and membranes if you think they'll be too spicy for you - this is your chance to make it as spicy as you like! You could also throw in a habanero (pierced with a knife) or some serranos to increase the heat.",
    "Slice the carrots as well - if you like them softer, go thinner than 1/4 inch.",
    "Slice the onion thinly, and crush the garlic cloves and remove the skins.",
    "Now you'll want to combine the water, vinegar, oregano, peppercorns, bay leaf, garlic, salt and sugar in a microwave-safe measuring cup."
