    "Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and then season lightly with salt.",
    "Combine the maple syrup, soy sauce, sriracha, white wine and ginger in a bowl and stir together.",
    "Add the chicken to a room temperature non-stick pan in a single layer with any bits of fat facing down, and then put it over medium high heat. This gives the fat a chance to render out so you don’t need to add any extra oil.",
    "Once the chicken is browned on one side, flip each piece, and brown the other side.",
    "Add the sauce, and turn up the heat to high. Bring the sauce to a boil, tossing the chicken occasionally to coat evenly with the sauce as it thickens.",
    "The chicken is done when there’s no sauce left in the pan. Garnish with cilantro and serve with rice."
