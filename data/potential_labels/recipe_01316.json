    "Combine hot sauce, melted butter, Worcestershire sauce, and onion powder in a bowl. Reserve 1/4 cup hot sauce mixture; pour remaining hot sauce mixture in a zip-top plastic bag. Add chicken breast halves to bag; seal. Marinate at room temperature 20 minutes (don't refrigerate it - the butter will harden). Remove chicken from bag; discard marinade in bag. Sprinkle chicken with salt. Grill chicken until done. Brush reserved marinade over chicken. Serve with light ranch dressing, if desired."
