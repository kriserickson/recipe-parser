    "Method: For the Ragu",
    "Heat some oil in a large pan and gently cook the onion, celery and carrot until the onion has softened and is translucent. Add the lentils and give a good stir to coat them in the mix. Add the tomatoes, herbs and the water/stock and bring to the boil. When the liquid has reduced by 1/3 lower the heat and leave to simmer for about 30 minutes, until the lentils have cooked. Add a splash of soy sauce or tamari to taste and remove the bay leaf before using the ragu.",
    "What you’ll need for the Béchamel: (makes a thick and creamy sauce)",
    "80g of vegan butter",
    "80g of flour",
    "700ml of unsweetened almond milk",
    "4 tablespoons of nutritional yeast",
    "3/4 of a whole nutmeg, ground",
    "salt and pepper for seasoning",
    "Method:",
    "Melt the butter in a pan over a low heat. Slowly whisk in the flour until you get a thick paste. This is called a roux and can be used to thicken any sauce or gravy.",
    "Heat the milk in a separate pan. Once it has started to bubble slowly add it to the roux, whisking all the time. You may feel like it will never reach the correct consistency but hold on in there, it will come together.",
    "Once all of the milk has been added to the roux and you have your thick sauce it’s time to add the flavouring. Grate in the nutmeg and stir in the nutritional yeast. The nutritional yeast is optional but it gives and extra cheesy element to the sauce. Season well with salt and pepper.",

    "bechemal",
    "100g grated violife cheese",
    "100g grated parmesan",
    "lasagne sheets",
    "Preheat the oven to 180°C. Cover the base of a large oven dish with a layer of lentil ragu. Top it with lasagne sheets followed by the same amount of béchamel sauce. Sprinkle some grated cheese over the béchamel and start the process again. Continue this until you reach the last layer of pasta. The top layer should be Béchamel sauce smothered with grated cheese.",
    "Put the lasagne dish onto an over tray in case of bubbling over and bake in the oven for 30 minutes."
