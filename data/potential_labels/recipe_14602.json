    "Mix the flour, eggs, baking powder, baking soda, orange juice, lemon juice, Sambuca, sugar, vegetable oil, and milk in a large bowl until smooth.",
    "In a small pot or cast-iron skillet, heat 2 1/2 inches of neutral oil to 350° F over medium heat. Using a teaspoon or a small ice cream scoop, scoop up a spoonful of batter, then carefully scrape it off with a second teaspoon into the hot oil.",
    "Cook the castagnole in batches of four or five for about 4 minutes, until a deep golden brown. Halfway through cooking, they will turn themselves over in the oil. Take care not to crowd the pan.",
    "Remove to a paper towel-lined tray or plate to drain, then roll them in sugar while they are still hot so that the sugar sticks.",
    "Castagnole are best eaten the day they are prepared, but they will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 to 4 days."
