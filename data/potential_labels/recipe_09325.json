    "Line an 8x8 baking dish with parchment paper. It helps to spray a little cooking spray on the dish before placing the parchment paper to help it stay in place. Cut the paper long enough to hang over the sides and use these as handles later to easily pick up the whole block and take it out of the pan. Set aside.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown rice cereal and freeze dried strawberries. Set aside.",
    "In a small pot on the stove, stir together the cashew butter, brown rice syrup and vanilla extract over low heat, stirring continuously, until pourable. This will only take a few minutes and the mixture will burn easily, so don't walk away!",
    "Pour the liquid mixture over the cereal and strawberries, while stirring. Work quickly as it will thicken up as it cools.",
    "Press the mixture evenly into the prepared baking dish. Placing another piece of parchment paper on top and pressing on that will help you to spread the mixture evenly.",
    "Let the Brown Rice Crispy Treats set in the pan for about an hour before taking them out to cut into squares."
