    "Directions",
    "1. Grease a round pie plate with oil (your choice, canola, olive, coconut, etc) You could also use a baking sheet, oiled and covered in parchment paper, or a square baking pan.",
    "2. Grind the sprouted lentils, either in a coffee grinder or food processor. I actually just use my coffee grinder, it works better than my food processor. See here for using a coffee grinder for grinding flour. I do the sprouted lentils first as they are stickier, than the dry, as the dry will absorb the mashed leftovers and make it easier to clean the grinder after!",
    "3. Grind the 2/3 c dry lentils, also in grinder of choice. See here for more details.",
    "4. Add water, salt and caraway seeds to ground lentils and combine. This will be a spreadable paste.",
    "5. Preheat oven to 350F.",
    "6. Pour paste into plate or pan and let rest 5-10 minutes while oven heats up.",
    "7. Bake about 15 minutes. If using a baking sheet, this may cook faster as it will be thinner."
