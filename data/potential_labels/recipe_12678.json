    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a 9 X 9 brownie pan or pyrex dish with parchment paper that extends up the sides of the pan. Butter parchment paper and set aside.",
    "In a medium bowl whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In another bowl beat together butter, sugar and egg with a hand mixer until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add chopped pecans and apples, and stir by hand until combined. Add flour mixture, and stir until combined.",
    "Spread batter in pan. Place caramel candies in a microwave safe bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, stir and then microwave for another 30 seconds. Drizzle caramel over batter, top with whole pecans and bake until golden, about 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then cut into 12 bars. If you like an extra caramel flavor for topping, drizzle additional melted caramel over the top of the cooled brownies and allow to set before cutting."
