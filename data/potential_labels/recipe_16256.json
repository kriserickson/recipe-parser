    "Add onion, and cook, stirring often, 3 minutes. Add bell peppers and garlic, and cook, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes. Add tomato, olives, and oregano. Continue to stir often, until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Place warm pitas on individual plates. Divide vegetable mixture into equal portions, and place each inside pita pocket to make a sandwich. Sprinkle each sandwich with crumbled feta cheese, and serve hot. Alternatively, place peppers in baking dish, and sprinkle with feta. Microwave until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Serve with or without pita bread."
