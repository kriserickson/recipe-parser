    "Directions",
    "Put butter into pan and melt. Pound chicken breasts if needed to flatten meat out. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Add chicken and brown on both sides, making sure the chicken is cooked through. Pull chicken out of pan and set aside.",
    "Wipe pan (I use a paper towel) and place back on burner. Add heavy whipping cream and Dijon mustard, stirring until blended. Add chicken back in and lower heat to a simmer. Let cook for 10 minutes.",
    "Rice prep - I don't know about you, but I had a really hard time getting my brown rice cooked all the way! That is, until I found these great directions: Use 1 cup dry rice to 4 cups water. Rinse rice. Bring water to boil and then add rice. Cook for 30 minutes with lid off. Then drain the rice of excess water and put it back into the pot (off heat) putting on the lid. Let steam for 10 minutes. (It is a lengthy process, but well worth it!)"
