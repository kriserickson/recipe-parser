    "Put flour and salt into a bowl. Using your fingers, work the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Add in 1 cup hot water and mix until moist but not sticky.",
    "Divide the dough into 12 equal-sized balls, place on a baking sheet, and cover with a towel to rest for 10 minutes.",
    "On a lightly floured surface and working with one ball of dough at a time, roll out the dough into a 7-inch circle.",
    "Heat a comal or nonstick skillet over medium-high and cook the tortillas, flipping once, until charred and puffed, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a board and wrap in a dish towel to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining balls of dough and then have a friggin' taco night or something."
