    "Sprinkle ¾ cup coarsely chopped almonds onto the bottom of an 18x13 inch cookie sheet. Set aside.",
    "In a 2 qt. sauce pan, combine sugar and butter over medium high heat while stirring frequently for several minutes unit bubbly and thick. Use a candy thermometer and cook until 290 degrees F. Watch carefully after 280 degrees F to prevent it from burning. Once it has reached 290 degrees F, remove from heat.",

    "Cover candy with layer of chocolate and sprinkle remaining almonds evenly over the top of chocolate layer.",
    "Allow to set up for a few hours. I place mine in the fridge when I need them to cool faster.",
    "Once completely set up and hardened, break into pieces using a knife.",
