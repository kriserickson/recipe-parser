    "Place a large pan on a medium heat, along with a little oil. Peel the onion and garlic, then roughly chop with the celery and add to the pan. Finely chop the coriander stalks and throw them in too, then cook for 8-10 minutes, or until soft and golden, then add the spices and keep cooking for a further couple of minutes, stirring until combined and smelling lovely.",
    "Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and roughly chop them, as well as the tomatoes. Add both to the pan, along with the lentils and vegetable stock. Bring to the boil and then turn down to simmer for 25-30 mins, until the potatoes are soft and the soup has thickened (feel free to add more water if you feel it needs it). Stir through the spinach if using, then season with salt and pepper. Now you can blitz up the soup, keep it chunky, or take out a few ladlefuls and blitz that then add it back to the chunky mix to create a mix of textures.",
    "Serve up into bowls with a dollop of natural or Greek yoghurt, top with the picked coriander leaves and serve with some toasted wholemeal bread."
