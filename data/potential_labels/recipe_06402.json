    "1. Peel the potatoes and then cut them in slices - but don't cut them all the way through - they are supposed to be whole, as you can see in the picture.",
    "2. Put them in an ovenproof dish, put a big piece of butter in the dish and season with salt. Then - into the oven - 225 degrees, for 45-60 minutes, depending on how big the potatoes are.",
    "3.As soon as the butter has melted, brush the potatoes with the melted butter. Do so again 3-4 times during the remaining time in the oven.",
    "4.When there are 10 minutes left of the time, sprinkle some bread crumbles on top of the potatoes, and, if you wish to, some grated cheese. Enjoy!"
