    "Cut the chicken into thin strips then mix with the ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼paprika and set aside.",
    "Heat the oil, then fry the onions, red pepper and garlic until soft. Add the chicken and cook for a further four minutes, making sure the chicken is cooked through.",
    "Chop the avocado and tomatoes then split, along with the chicken mix, between the tortillas. Serve with a dollop of yoghurt on the side for dipping. Or wrap it in foil and eat later. When it comes to the crunch, this is a seriously good lunch."
