    "BASH black olives and remove the pits, peel and finely slice garlic cloves, and put both of these into a large saucepan on a medium heat with a lug of olive oil, capers and dried chili flakes. Fry for a couple of minutes, then pour in diced tomatoes. Add a splash of water to one of the empty cans, swirl it around and add to the pan. Drain and flake in tuna, bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer for around 15 min.",
    "MEANWHILE, cook pasta shells according to package instructions and drain, reserving a cupful of cooking water. Toss the pasta through the sauce, loosening with cooking water if necessary. Serve with a grating of lemon zest for added zing."
