    "Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Heat the olive oil in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, and cook until fragrant and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and mushroom slices, and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Toss in the asparagus and thyme leaves, cook for another 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
    "While the veggies are cooking, whisk the eggs, then fold in the cubed feta. When the veggies are ready, pour the egg-cheese mixture over top of the vegetables, making sure the eggs coat the vegetables evenly. Once the edges firm up, transfer the skillet into the preheated oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the center is no longer wobbly and the top is golden.",
