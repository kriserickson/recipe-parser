    "In a medium bowl, use a fork to mix the ingredients until very smooth.",
    "Using a spatula, transfer to a small pyrex bowl (mine measures 2 inches on the bottom and 4 inches at the top).",
    "Microwave on high for 90 seconds. Bread will puff up while \"baking,\" then deflate. When done, it will look like a muffin. Make sure it appears set, otherwise microwave 30 more seconds (but 90 seconds should be enough, and overcooking can dry it up).",
    "Gently, with a small knife, loosen the bread edges and remove from the bowl onto a plate. Slice into two slices and top with your favorite toppings."
