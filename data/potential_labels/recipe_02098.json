    "Chocolate Mug Cake Recipe: Grease a mug or 1-cup ramekin and set aside. (If using the oven, preheat to 350 F.) In a cereal bowl, stir all dry ingredients together fully. Add all remaining ingredients except the 3 tbsp banana and stir. Pour half the batter into the greased mug, then make a well in the middle with your spoon. Fill the well with the 3 tbsp banana, then smooth the rest of the batter on top. Either microwave 50-70 seconds (depending on microwave wattage) OR bake in the oven for 13-14 minutes. If you donâ€™t want to eat the cake straight from the dish, be sure to wait for it to cool completely before trying to remove from the dish."
