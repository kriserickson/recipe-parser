Whisk in the stock and thyme, bring to a simmer, and cook until the soup is slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and discard the thyme.",

    "Divide eight 16-ounce ovenproof crocks between 2 baking sheets. Put a slice of bread in the bottom of each crock. Fill each crock until three-quarters full. Place another slice of baguette over each soup and divide the cheese on top. Carefully slide the crocks under the broiler and broil until the cheese is melted and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the broiler and top each with a dollop of parsley pesto.",
