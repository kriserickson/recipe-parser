    "Preheat oven to 375Â°. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Whisk flour into the butter and garlic and cook until mixture is bubbling and golden, 1 minute more. Gradually pour in milk, whisking constantly. Bring mixture to a simmer, then stir in Parmesan. Let simmer until the sauce thickens, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add lemon juice and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
    "Spoon a thin layer of Alfredo sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. On a clean surface, lay 3 pieces of zucchini down slightly overlapping each other. Spoon Alfredo sauce on top then top with chicken and a sprinkle of mozzarella. Roll up tightly and place in prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining zucchini and top with Parmesan. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden on top and baked through."
