    "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil and add rice. Let cook for 30 minutes, then drain. Return rice to the empty pot, cover with lid and let rice rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring 2 cups of salted water to a boil in a small pot and add the quinoa. Cover pot and let simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes longer. Fluff both grains with a fork.",
