    "Add the milk, cream cheese, flour and kosher salt to a blender. Blend until completely smooth and creamy. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute about 30 seconds. Carefully pour in the sauce mixture. Stir constantly for 3-4 minutes or until it comes to a simmer. Add Italian seasoning, onion powder and salt and pepper. Taste, and add more seasoning, if needed. Continue cooking until sauce thickens, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes or so.",
    "Once it reaches desired consistency, add the shredded Swiss cheese and stir until melted. Add the shredded chicken, chopped ham, crumbled bacon and cooked pasta. Stir together until everything is coated in sauce. Pour into a large casserole dish. Cover top with Panko bread crumbs, parsley and a little powdered Parmesan cheese. Or, you can omit those three ingredients and use Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Spray topping lightly with butter spray. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 - 20 minutes or until hot and bubbly and bread crumbs are lightly browned. (If you don't care about the bread crumbs being browned, you could skip the baking part and eat this immediately as it will be creamier if you don't bake it). Serves: 4 - 6"
