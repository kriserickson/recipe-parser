    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.",
    "Dry the pork chops off on both sides with paper towels. Sprinkle both sides generously with sea salt. Lay the pork chops on a baking sheet with plenty of space in between them and place the baking sheet in the preheated oven.",
    "Cook the pork chops for 15-20 minutes, or until juices coming out of the pork chops are clear.",
    "Heat 1 tablespoon of ghee, coconut oil, lard, or bacon fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat. If desired, saut√© some garlic or fresh herbs in the skillet before adding the pork chops. When the oil is very hot, add the pork chops to the pan, without crowding. If you need to work in batches, do so. Sear the chops for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until a brown crust develops.",
    "While the pork sears, place a metal rack (like a cookie cooling rack) over a large plate or baking sheet. As the chops finish searing, remove them to the rack. Let the pork chops rest for 5-10 minutes before serving."
