    "Put all ingredients but the flour into the mixer (KitchenAid) and let sit for a few minutes so, as Lindsey likes to say, \"the yeast can do it's thing\". Add the flour in small batches & mix with a dough hook for 8-10 minutes. Remove & place in a bowl that has been greased & let dough rise until double in size (about 30 min). Punch down & divide in half into 2 rounds and place on a greased cookie sheet. Cut decorative slits on top. Let dough rise again. Rub an egg white wash (1 egg white + 1 tbsp water) over the top and sprinkle with kosher salt. I added the dried rosemary & parmesan here. Bake at 400 degrees for 17-20 minutes (for me it took about 25 minutes).",
    "*I used regular (non-rapid rise) yeast and so it took longer for the dough to rise- a few hours.",
    "**You can also use wheat flour or do half & half."
