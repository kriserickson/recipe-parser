    "With a sharp paring knife, cut cauliflower florets off stem and chop into 1-2” pieces. This will make “ricing” them much easier in your food processor. This is important because as I mentioned in the Spanish Riced Cauliflower recipe, if you overload the processor with big chunks of cauliflower you’ll be left with ugly mush. I normally do about 2 cups of cauliflower at a time with my Vitamix, between levels 1-",
    "Once all of the cauliflower is “riced,” place in a non-stick pan over medium high heat with oil.",
    "Stir in the coconut milk and salt and pepper, making sure it’s mixed well with the cauliflower. Continue cooking and stirring every so often for 12-15 minutes, or until cauliflower is cooked through and the coconut milk has evaporated. If you like your rice stickier, try adding a little more coconut milk (like ¼ cup) about halfway through cooking.",
    "Sprinkle sesame seeds on top and it’s ready to serve! I love this recipe with coconut aminos, chicken stir fry and everything else for that matter. This recipe really goes well with anything!"
