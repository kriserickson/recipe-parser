    "Preheat the oven to 425°F. Coat a sheet pan with cooking spray.",
    "Combine the scallions, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a bowl; add the chicken and toss thoroughly. Let it stand at room temperature while you prepare the rice.",
    "Spread the rice on the sheet pan. Combine 2 1/4 cups water and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and pour it over the rice. Bake for 15 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, combine the carrots, 2 teaspoons of the canola oil, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a large bowl.",
    "After the rice has cooked for 15 minutes, give it a stir and smooth it into an even layer. Top it with the carrots and the chicken and roast for 20 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, add the bok choy to the now-empty large bowl and toss with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Combine the hoisin sauce and the marmalade in a small bowl.",
    "After it has roasted for 20 minutes, brush the chicken with half the hoisin mixture. Place the bok choy halves, cut side down, on the pan and roast for 10 minutes. Brush the chicken with the remaining hoisin mixture and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the largest piece of the breast registers 160°F, 10 to 12 minutes more."
