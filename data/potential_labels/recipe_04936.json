    "Whisk the arrowroot with 1/2 cup of the coconut milk till no lumps remain. Set aside.",
    "Heat the remaining coconut milk until it's just developing bubbles on the edges of a medium sized sauce pan. Add the cane juice vanilla, and sea salt. Whisk in the arrowroot mixture slowly. Continue cooking till mixture has the thick texture of a custard. Remove from heat and chill overnight. At this point, prepare your ice cream maker by chilling the bowl overnight as well.",
