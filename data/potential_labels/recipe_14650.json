    "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in broccoli stalks, ginger, sun-dried tomatoes, hot pepper, lemon zest, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, about 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "Mix in chickpeas and broccoli florets and cook for 1 minute. Pour in coconut milk and stir to combine. Lower heat and braise for about 10 minutes, until broccoli florets are bright green and coconut milk has mostly been absorbed. Stir in lemon juice, and adjust salt to taste."
