    "In a large pot over medium heat, add the olive oil and the yellow onion. Sweat the onion, stirring often for 5 minutes until soft. You don’t want any browning of the onions, so be sure to turn the heat down if you are worried about color on the onions.",
    "Add the garlic and the ginger and continue to cook, stirring often for another 3to 4 minutes.",
    "Add the Carrots and stir, cooking another 2-3 minutes. Add the broth and cover the pot. Reduce the heat to low and simmer on lowest heat for 30 minutes until the carrots are very soft.",
    "Transfer the soup to a blender (or use an immersion blender) and puree on high until the soup is very smooth. Season generously with kosher salt.",
    "This soup can be gently reheated and served hot or is delicious chilled and served cold."
