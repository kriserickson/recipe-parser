    "Place the chicken sings in a single layer in a wide, shallow, non-reactive dish. Pour or brush over the marinade, cover and place in the fridge to marinate for 24 hours.",
    "Cook the wings on a hot barbecue or griddle pan for 15 to 20 minutes, or until dark and the juices run clear, turning often. If cooking on a griddle, finish the wings in the oven at 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 for 10 to 15 minutes to make sure they’re cooked through."
