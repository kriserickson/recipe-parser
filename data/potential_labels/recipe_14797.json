    "Cook and drain fettuccine noodles according to package instructions. I usually add a tiny bit of olive oil to the noodles as they cook to prevent them from sticking together. Of course, most of it drains off of them. Return drained noodles to a pot or large skillet and set aside away from the stove.",

    "In a blender, combine remaining ingredients and blend until very smooth.",
    "Step 3",
    "Pour blender contents over fettuccine noodles in the pot or skillet and place on medium heat.",
    "Step 4",
    "Cook until sauce begins to thicken slightly--this usually only takes about 2-5 minutes. Be careful not to let your sauce boil for too long, as this results in a clumpy sauce. This sauce will thicken a little more as it cools.",
    "Step 5",
    "Serve hot and enjoy!"
