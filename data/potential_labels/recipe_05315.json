    "Preheat your oven to 400 F.",
    "Grab a large roasting pan and place it directly onto the stove. Set the burners underneath to high heat.",
    "Meanwhile, gently prick the sausages all over with a fork. This will help the steam to escape as they cook.",
    "Once the roasting pan is hot place the sausage into the pan (add a drizzle of oil if your surface is not non-stick). Brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Drain any residual oil and wipe out the pan. Line with parchment paper and add back the sausage.",
    "Add the onions, potatoes, peppers, and rosemary sprigs. Drizzle with olive oil. Mix well and season lightly with salt and pepper. You don't wan't to overdo it with the salt- the sausage is salty enough!",
    "Bake in the center of the oven, stirring once, until the sausage is cooked through and the potatoes are golden. This will take about 30 minutes.",
    "To serve, pile everything onto a nice platter. Drizzle with balsamic glaze (if using) and salad on the side."
