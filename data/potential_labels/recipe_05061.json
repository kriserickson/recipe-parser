    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil the pasta until al dente, drain.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large serving bowl, combine the basil pesto, sun-dried tomato pesto, juice of 1 lemon, olives, red peppers, corn kernels, peach or nectarine, cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese and a pinch of smoked salt, pepper and crushed red pepper. Add the hot pasta and a little drizzle of olive oil. Toss well to combine. Top with toasted sunflower seeds and fresh sprouts. Serve warm or at room temperature, but my family personally loves this warm. The salad can be kept in the fridge for up to 4 days. I have found that the longer it sits, the more flavorful it gets."
