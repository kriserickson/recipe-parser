    "Start by making a mound of flour on your countertop with a well in the middle of that you can crack two or three eggs in.",
    "1",
    "Followed by a little drizzle of olive oil (optional), and a pinch of salt.",
    "2",
    "Grab a fork and beat/whisk the eggs picking up a little flour with every stroke of the fork.",
    "3",
    "Once it becomes too sticky grab a bench scraper and start folding everything towards the center.",
    "4",
    "Once a shaggy dough starts to form begin to knead the dough by hand for a solid ten minutes. Knead until sore, or when the dough has the consistency of play dough.",
    "5",
    "Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for at least thirty minutes. This lets the gluten relax a little bit before rolling it out.",
    "6",
    "After thirty minutes, unwrap the dough and start flouring everything - your hands, the dough, the rolling pin, the countertop, and anything else you think needs flouring around you.",
    "7",
    "Once finished flouring, cut the dough down the center into two halves.",
    "8",
    "Now it’s time to start gently rolling/laminating it out. Roll like you would be using a pasta machine by rolling it out followed by folding into thirds, turn it 90 degrees and then rolling out again. Do this 3 times total before going for the big time roll. Roll until you can almost see your hand through it.",
    "9",
    "Once you have the dough rolled out to size and thickness it is time to cut. Start by cutting off the edges to give you an even rectangle. From here you can make lasagna noodles, or filled pasta like tortellini or ravioli.",
    "10",
    "For simple pasta, loosely fold the dough cutting it into nice wide fettuccine pieces. Once finished cutting, unfold all of the pieces to make sure none of them are stuck together.",
    "11",
    "Once all of the noodles are unwound, lift up the noodles and toss them with a little bit of flour to make sure they don’t stick together. Make sure each individual strand is coated with floured.",
    "12",
    "Hang to dry or placed under plastic wrap until ready to use.",
    "13",
    "Enjoy!"
