    "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\nDry-fry the duck legs in an ovenproof\nfrying pan or casserole dish on a low\nheat for a good 10-15 mins, turning once,\nuntil coloured all over. Remove from the\npan. Add the sugar to the fat in the pan\nand cook until caramelised, then add the\ncurry paste and cook for few mins until\nfragrant. Stir in the coconut milk and half\na can of water. Simmer and stir until\neverything is combined, then add the\nfish sauce and lime leaves.",
    "Slip in the duck legs, cover the pan\nand cook in the oven for 1Â½ hrs until the\nduck is really tender. Lift the duck legs\ninto a serving dish and remove fat from\nthe sauce, if you like. The curry can be\nprepared to this stage up to 2 days ahead and left in\nthe fridge, in which case it will be easier\nto remove the fat.",
    "Place the pan back on\nthe heat, add the pineapple and simmer\nfor 2 mins. Adjust the seasoning, adding\nmore fish sauce for salt, and more sugar\nfor sweetness. At the last moment, stir\nthrough half the chilli and half the Thai\nbasil leaves, if using, pour over the duck,\nthen scatter with the rest of the chilli\nand basil. Serve with jasmine rice"
