    "I like to serve this buffet style so everyone can make their lettuce wraps just the way they like them. I serve it with the chicken mixture in a bowl, the lettuce out on a plate {or, lets be honest, probably my cutting board}, and the toppings in their own bowls. To assemble lettuce wrap, place one leaf of lettuce in your hand or on a plate. Add a scoop of the chicken mixture and top with the chow mein noodles, slivered almonds and a pinch of sesame seeds (which I forgot to put on before I took these picsâ€¦ oops)."
