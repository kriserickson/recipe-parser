    "Instructions",
    "First, preheat a 10‚Äù cast iron skillet over high heat.",
    "Once the pan is hot enough that you can only hold your hand a few inches from the surface for a few seconds, turn the heat down to the medium.",
    "Meanwhile, combine the coffee grounds, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders.",
    "Rub this mixture very generously on the steaks, including the sides.",
    "Once the pan is hot and the heat has been turned down to medium, add the vegetable oil to the pan.",
    "Carefully tilt the pan to coat it evenly.",
    "Add the steaks and do not move them for at least 5 minutes.",
    "Have a meat thermometer handy.",
    "After 5 minutes, flip the steaks. Depending on how you like your steaks, cook them another 4-9 minutes. I used a meat thermometer to ensure 140-degrees for medium.",
    "When the steaks are 5-degrees below your ideal range, remove them from the pan and wrap in foil. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.",
    "Preheat the oven to 400-degrees.",
    "On a half-sheet pan, add the Brussels sprouts, steak seasoning and olive oil. Toss everything with your hands to coat.",
    "Roast the sprouts for 13-16 minutes, checking towards the end of the cooking time.",
    "Serve immediately"
