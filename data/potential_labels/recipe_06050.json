    "I made the butternut squash puree myself by peeling and cutting up a butternut squash. I steamed the butternut chunks for 20 minutes till soft. Cooking them is also an option. Then I put the steamed chunks in a food processor and turned them into a puree. Use 1/2 cup of this puree for this recipe.",

    "Take a big mixing bowl and add: butternut puree, agave syrup, coconut oil (in a melted state), molasses, pumpkin pie spices and salt. Stir these ingredients together with a spoon or spatula. Using a food processor for making the batter will work fine too.",
    "Put the spelt flour, the corn flour and the baking powder on top of the mix and pour the beer over it. The batter will start to bubble because of the beer.",
