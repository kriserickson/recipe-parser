    "Preheat oven to 375-degrees and line 2 baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together the flaxseed meal and the water and set aside. Put the blueberries and goji berries in a small bowl and cover with warm water for about 15 minutes to rehydrate. Drain and set aside.",
    "In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the coconut butter, maple syrup, banana, vanilla extract, salt and flaxseed meal mixture. Process until very smooth.",
    "In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the oat flour, cocoa or cacao powder, arrowroot powder, stevia, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and cardamom. Carefully pour into the bowl with the coconut butter mixture and process at medium-low speed to incorporate the dry ingredients fully into the wet ingredients. Add the chocolate chips, blueberries, and goji berries and pulse to blend into the cookie dough. The dough will be very sticky.",
    "Drop dough by the heaped tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheets. Flatten and shape slightly. Bake for 10-12 minutes, switching pans halfway through for even baking. Let cookies cool on the pan for about 10 minutes before removing them and placing them on cooling racks."
