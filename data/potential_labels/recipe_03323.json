    "Method:",
    "In a bowl, mix in all the Orange Sauce ingredients. Set aside. Make the Frying Batter. In a large bowl, whisk eggs and mix in the rest of the Frying Batter ingredients until batter is smooth. Drop in the chicken cubes, mix well, and set aside.",
    "Heat up a wok with deep-frying oil. Gently drop in the battered chicken cubes, one by one, making sure it is spread out to prevent sticking and over crowding the wok. Deep-fry until color changes to golden brown and completely cooked. Dish out and drain on paper towels.",
    "Heat up wok over medium-high heat with 2 teaspoons of cooking oil. Stir-fry the garlic until fragrant. Gently pour in the Orange Sauce mixture, stir, and bring it to a light simmer. You may adjust additional seasoning to taste, ie. water (if sauce is too thick, cornstarch solution to thicken sauce), salt, sugar, chili sauce, etc. Toss in the deep-fried chicken, stir well until sauces all absorbed and lightly thickened up. Dish out and ready to serve with hot steamed white rice. Garnish with chopped scallions and sesame."
