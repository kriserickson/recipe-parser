    "1Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Blend the first 6 ingredients then beat on high for 6 mins.",
    "2Pour batter into a non stick Bundt Pan (I still spray lightly with Baker's Joy before I add batter)",
    "3Bake in a pre-heated oven on middle rack for 40 to 45 minutes. Top should be golden brown. Remove from oven.",
    "4While cake is still hot add topping ingredients to a small saucepan on a med heat. Bring to a boil and let rapidly boil for a couple minutes, while stirring. Watch carefully so it doesn't boil over. Take a large fork (with 2 tines) and poke holes in still hot cake. Slowly pour or spoon topping over entire hot cake and leave in bundt pan until all the liquid is absorbed. Then turn cake upside down on serving plate. Sprinkle with powdered sugar or decorate with fresh fruit. Very rich, so easily cut into 16 servings. Even better if cake is still a little warm. A crown pleaser for sure. (make sure everyone knows there is alcohol in cake in case of sensitivites) Enjoy!"
