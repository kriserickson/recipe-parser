    "In a medium pot, bring stock to a simmer with 1 teaspoon salt. Once stock is simmering, add spinach and cook until tender, about 3 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, grated cheese, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and some freshly ground black pepper to taste.",
    "Once spinach is tender, add about 1/3 of the egg mixture to the soup, while continuously whisking, to make shreds of eggs. Add remaining eggs in 2 more batches, letting the soup return to a boil between additions. Once all of the eggs have been added, bring soup to a final boil and use the whisk to break up any large clusters of eggs. Serve soup with additional grated cheese."
