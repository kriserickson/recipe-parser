    "Heat the oven to 350°F. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat (or in a small bowl in the microwave). Break up the gingersnaps slightly; put them in a food processor and pulse until they are finely ground. Add the butter, flour, and 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Pulse a few times to combine. Press the gingersnap mixture evenly into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan, and bake for 5 minutes.",
    "Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Whisk in the remaining ¾ cup sugar and the pumpkin, half-and-half, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves. Transfer the pumpkin mixture to the crust, and bake at 350°F until a knife inserted into the center of the pie comes out clean, about 1 hour. (The center of the pie will not be completely firm.) Cool thoroughly. Serve at room temperature, or cover with foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to a day before serving. (Store leftover pumpkin pie covered with foil or plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to several days.)"
