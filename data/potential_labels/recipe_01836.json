    "Place the jasmine rice in a medium pot. Rinse 3-4 times with cool water, draining off as much water as possible after the last rinse. Add the can of coconut milk and one cup of water. Place a lid on top and bring up to a full boil over medium/high heat. As soon as it reaches a boil immediately turn the heat down to low and let simmer for 20 minutes (do not remove the lid during this time).",
    "While the pot is simmering, cube the mango. For a step by step image tutorial on how to cut a mango, click here.",
    "After the rice has simmered for 20 minutes, turn off the heat and let it sit, undisturbed, for an additional 10 minutes. Once it has rested, remove the lid and fluff with a fork. Slowly drizzle the honey over top while fluffing to mix it in. Add the cubed mango and stir again. Serve warm."
