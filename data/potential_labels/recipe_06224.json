    "One of the best ways to start is to find a fresh Salmon Filet at your local grocery store or fish market and once it is clean, carefully cut 1/4lb filet pieces, wrapping the extra pieces in Saran Wrap and the sealing in a Freezer style Zip-Lock bag and quickly freezing. Next, set your oven to broil, setting your rack on the second level down. Line a small baking sheet or pan with foil and lightly spray with Pam or a similar product (You can also apply a very light coating of Olive Oil if you do not have Pam.) Taking your piece of Salmon, you squeeze the lemon juice on it, gently rubbing the juice into the meat of the Salmon. You then rinse under cold water and then patting dry to remove the excess moisture. Place the filet skin down on the foil and then sprinkle the salt and paprika to taste. Lay the onion slices on the filet and then pour the Balsamic Vinegar directly over them. Sprinkle some Tabasco Sauce to taste and top of with the 5 shots of the spray margarine. Set this aside and prepare your side dishes saving the final 8 minutes of cooking time to put the Salmon in the oven. The Salmon is done when you can easily flake off a corner with a fork. Cooking times will vary depending on thickness of the filet. Serve the Salmon on the serving of Brown Rice with the Squash on the side and enjoy!!",
