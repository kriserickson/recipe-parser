    "Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add gnocchi and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Stir in peas and cook until the gnocchi are tender, 1 to 2 minutes more. Drain.",
    "Meanwhile, toss chicken with flour in a bowl until coated. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Transfer the chicken to the pan (reserving the flour remaining in the bowl) and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate.",
    "Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan. Add carrots, celery, onion, thyme and the remaining ¼ teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are crisp-tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle the reserved flour over the vegetables; stir to coat. Stir in broth and the chicken. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the stew is thickened, about 3 minutes. Add the gnocchi and peas and cook, gently stirring, until the gnocchi are hot, about 2 minutes."
