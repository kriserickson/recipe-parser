    "Add the olive oil to a large sauté pan set over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly until the garlic is toasted, about 2 minutes. Add the eggplant and cook, stirring occasionally until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes, season with salt, and cook until the tomatoes just begin to break down, about 8 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until just al dente, about 7 minutes. Drain pasta and transfer to the tomato sauce and toss with half the basil and red pepper flakes to combine. Simmer until the pasta has soaked a bit of the sauce and the basil has wilted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve with remaining basil and garnish with Grana Padano."
