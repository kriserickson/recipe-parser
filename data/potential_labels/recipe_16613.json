    "Cream the butter with sugar, egg yolk, salt and vanilla extract until fluffy. Add in the milk powder, full milk, and mix well.",
    "Fold in the all-purpose flour and corn starch. Mix until the dough becomes soft and not stick to hands.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350 degree Fahrenheit. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silplat. Transfer the cookie dough into the cookie press with your desired pattern. Ratchet the dough out onto the baking sheets. Make sure to leave some space in between the cookies. Top the cookies with some sprinkles and place the baking sheets in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes. This will firm up the dough so the cookies will maintain their shape when baked.",
    "Bake for about 13-14 minutes, or until cookies are completely cooked through inside or turn slightly brown. Cool on rack."
