    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook noodles to al dente. If using brown rice pasta you will need to rinse the noodles when draining to keep the firm texture. Just before adding them to the sauce you can rinse them again with cold water to prevent sticking.",
    "Meanwhile, rinse and drain cashews from the soaking water and add to a high-powered blender along with water, apple cider vinegar, and lemon juice. Blend until very smooth.",
    "In a large pan over medium heat sauté onion in olive oil for 2 minutes until soft and fragrant.",
    "Then add mushrooms and cook for 4 minutes. When mushrooms are half cooked and start to release some moisture, stir in minced garlic, sea salt, and ground pepper and cook for another 3-4 minutes.",
