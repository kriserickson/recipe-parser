    "Rinse the rice until it runs clear in a colander under running water. Add it to a medium pan on high heat, pour over the water, bringing it to a boil.",
    "Reduce the temperature to low, partially cover and let cook for 15 minutes. Then turn off the heat, cover with a lid, and leave for another 5 minutes, until rice is fluffy and water is absorbed.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar and salt. If the sugar crystals don't dissolve, pop it in the microwave for a few seconds.",
    "Gently scoop out rice and place in a shallow container to let it cool. Pour over the vinegar mixture and gently fold it in while the rice is still warm.",
    "Let the rice cool to room temperature. Now it's ready to use in your sushi!"
