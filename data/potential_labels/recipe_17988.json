    "Sift the all-purpose flour into a big bowl and then add the salt and chicken bouillon powder into the flour. Combine well and set aside.",
    "Heat the water to a boil. Slowly add the water to the flour and knead the dough until it becomes soft, no longer sticky and the surface becomes smooth and shiny, about 15 minutes. If the dough is too dry, add 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of water to the dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.",
    "Add the green onion into the dough and combine well.",
    "Make the Green Onion Pancake by following the picture guide below.",
    "Add about 1/4 inch (6 mm) of oil into a stir-fry pan or skillet over moderately high heat. Transfer a piece of the pancake onto the pan or skillet. Shallow fry each side of the pancake to a light golden brown, about 1 minute. Flip the pancake over and shallow fry the other side. Add more oil, repeat the same for the remaining pancakes and serve immediately. They are best eaten with warm andÂ homemade soy milk."
