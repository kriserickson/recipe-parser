    "... I know, I know but bare with me as I explain... you see my lovely editor at Lincolnshire Life Magazine has asked me to get my December recipes in early this year so this weekend is all about developing recipes for Christmas... it feels a bit odd to get my christmas spirit on so early but this year my idea is to concentrate on left-overs as I really feel that once the big day is over and all the energy has gone into that one giant meal there's so much to play with and so many amazing things left in the fridge that this is the really exciting bit...",
    "christmas cake brownies",
    "my first idea was based on the fact that the christmas cake and the christmas pudding are a little bit of a 'marmite' food item, you either love them or hate them but however you feel about them there always seems to be some in the house and whilst it may appear as though they last forever, lurking in the back of the fridge, they should be eaten and enjoyed and crumbling them into these brownies seems like a great way for everyone to enjoy them... and you will enjoy them... I had these in the fridge overnight and they are the most incredible brownies i've eaten in a long while!",

    "in a pan gently melt the butter and chocolate - do this over a really low heat and stir regularly - take it off the heat before it's fully melted and set aside to cool, stirring again as it melts",
    "in a large bowl beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mix for about 6 minutes until it doubles in volume and becomes pale, light and airy then pour in the melted and cooled chocolate and gently fold in until it's fully combined",
    "sieve in the flour, salt and cocoa and again, gently fold in, then crumble in the cake or pudding, including any icing or marzipan and pour the mixture into your brownie pan",
    "bake on 160C for 25 mins then remove from the oven and let it cool in the tin - cut into squares and serve"
