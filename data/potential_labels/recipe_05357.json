    "Prepare the chicken salad: If using canned chicken, drain then shred with a fork in a medium sized bowl. Add Miracle Whip/mayonnaise and mustard. Season with Salad Supreme, celery salt, garlic powder, pepper and salt to taste. Mix well and set aside.",
    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.",
    "Slice the onion and place in a frying pan with a thin layer of water, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Fry the onion over medium heat stirring regularly until the water steams off. Continue to cook for a few minute until the onions turn golden in color, but are still soft.",
    "Lightly grease a cookie sheet. Place slices of bread in a single layer on the cookie sheet. Spread chicken salad across each slice of bread until it's evenly distributed.",
    "Layer 3 slices of ham on top of slice of bread, followed by 1 slice of provolone. Top each one with fried onions.",
    "Bake for 10 minutes or until cheese is melted."
