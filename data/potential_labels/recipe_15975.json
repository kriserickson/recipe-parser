    "In a mixing bowl, add the eggs, milk, baking powder (if using), spices, salt and pepper. Quickly and vigorously whisk to combine.",
    "In a 10-inch non-stick skillet, heat extra virgin olive oil until shimmering but not smoking. Be sure to tilt the skillet to coat the bottom well with oil.",
    "Pour the egg mixture in and immediately stir with a heat-resistant spatula for like 5 seconds. Then push the cooked portions at the edge toward the center, tilting the pan to allow uncooked egg to fill in around the edges. When no more egg runs to the sides, continue to cook until almost set and the bottom is light golden (about 1 minute.) Remember, the omelette has more time to cook once filled and folded.",
    "Remove the skillet from the heat. Spoon a good portion of the toppings onto the center third of the omelette. Use the spatula to fold. Add the remainder of the toppings on top. Sprinkle a little more fresh herbs.",
    "Slice the omelette into two halves and serve hot. If you like, add a side of Greek tzatziki sauce and warm pita bread. Enjoy!"
