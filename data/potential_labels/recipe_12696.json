    "Cook your peas in a little salted water – we all like them a bit differently, but don’t overcook or we’ll be having spicy mushy peas at this rate. I like to cook mine till they are tender, with a sweet pop, and still retain their lovely colour.",
    "Once drained, add the butter, and then chilli and mint a little at a time, and mash with a fork or potato masher (is that what that is called?). You want a textured pea mixture, not mash, or sludge. So leave some peas whole and some crushed. Taste, add more chilli and mint if you like."
