    "Directions",
    "1. To make the smashed avo, scoop out the avocado and use a fork to roughly mash it. Stir in the salt, feta, chopped mint, lemon juice & chilli.",
    "2. To poach the eggs fill a large saucepan with water and the vinegar. Bring to the boil, then reduce heat to medium. Using a wooden spoon create a whirpool in the water and quickly break the eggs one at a time, into the middle of it. An easy tip is to crack your eggs indivually on a small saucer first so you can easily slip them into the water.",
    "3. Poach eggs for 2-4 mins depending on how runny you like them. I settle for the middle - 3 minutes.",
    "4. Toast your bread.",
    "5. Assemble smashed avo on your toast, topped with poached eggs and a little drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."
