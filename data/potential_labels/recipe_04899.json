    "In a large bowl, mash the potatoes well.",
    "Add the rest of the ingredients, mix well.",
    "Shape into patties and pan fry them with a little oil on medium heat until both sides are golden and crisp.",
    "Patties can be served as is with sauce of choice like ketchup, Sriracha or BBQ.",
    "To serve Tikki chole, ladle some chickpea curry below or on top of the patties.",
    "Top them with chopped onion and cilantro.",
    "For variation, top with Tamarind date chutney or a little Barbecue sauce.",
    "Notes:",
    "The patties can also be baked at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes. I like them crisped up on the pan much better and they need just a few teaspoons of oil on a good pan.",
    "You can also use wheat flour or chickpea flour instead of bread to help balance the moisture in the patty mixture. Mash and mix the ingredients well and make tight patties so they dont break while flipping.",
    "You can use Sweet Potatoes instead of potatoes. The patties will need bread crumbs to balance the extra moisture and will need to be baked, if using sweet potatoes."
