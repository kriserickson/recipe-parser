    "In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the taco seasoning and set it aside (or use one envelope of store-bought taco seasoning).",
    "Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion, garlic, and cooking oil to a large skillet. Sauté the onion and garlic over medium heat until the onion is soft and transparent (about 5 minutes). Add the ground beef and prepared taco seasoning and continue to sauté until the beef is cooked through (another 5 minutes). Drain the can of black beans and then stir them into the seasoned beef.",
    "Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Arrange the taco shells in a casserole dish so they are all standing upright. If you do not have a dish that fits them snuggly enough to hold them up, use balled up aluminum foil to act as \"book ends\" to help hold the line of tacos upright.",
    "Fill the tacos with the beef and bean mixture. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over top. Bake the tacos in the preheated oven for 7-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the taco shells are golden brown on the edges.",
    "While the tacos are baking, dice the tomato, slice the jalapeño, and roughly chop the cilantro leaves. Sprinkle the diced tomato, jalapeño and cilantro over the tacos just before serving."
