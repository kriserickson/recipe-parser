    "Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add onion and poblano and saute for 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft and translucent, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and saute for an additional minute, stirring occasionally. Add the diced green chiles, chicken stock, hominy, chicken, cumin and salt, and stir to combine. Continue heating until the soup reaches a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for at least 5 minutes. Taste, and season with extra salt and pepper if needed.",

    "This soup can also be made easilyÂ in the slow cooker. Just add all of your ingredients (minus the garnishes) to your slow cooker, and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours until the onions are cooked through and soft. Serve warm, topped with your desired garnishes."
