    "Preheat your oven to 400 degrees",
    "For the meatballs, mix all the ingredients except the sweet chili sauce in a medium bowl with your hands until evenly combined (the pork, scallions, ginger, garlic, fish sauce, sriracha, salt, and lime juice)",
    "Dampen a paper towel with some vegetable oil (canola or coconut oil works too), and wipe it onto a baking sheet to grease it",
    "Using about 1 heaping tablespoon of meat mixture each, form meatballs and place them on the baking sheet",
    "Bake the meatballs for 15 minutes or until they are fully cooked through in the middle, flipping once half way through with a spatula",
    "Meanwhile, make your coleslaw",
    "In a medium bow, combine all your coleslaw ingredients (the bag of coleslaw mix, basil, mint, cilantro, and scallions)",
    "To make your dressing, whisk together the rice vinegar, mayonnaise, and sweet chili sauce in a small bowl and pour over the coleslaw, tossing to coat",
    "Set aside until the meatballs are finished baking",
    "When the meatballs are done, transfer them to a bowl and toss with 1-2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce (they should just have a very light coating)",
    "To assemble, start with a lettuce cup, spoon in a pile of coleslaw, and top with three meatballs",
    "Top with a little extra cilantro (optional), and an extra squeeze of lime juice (highly recommended!)",
    "Note: if you don't want to deal with the lettuce wrap (they can get a bit messy!), just serve the meatballs on a bed of the coleslaw, squeeze a little lime juice on top, and eat with a fork!"
