    "Peel, halve and pit the avocado, cut into one-centimetre wedges. Finely chop the spring onions. Peel the orange and separate the segments from each other.",
    "Whisk the vinegar, olive oil, ginger, soy sauce and sesame oil together to form the dressing, season to taste.",
    "In a large bowl, mix the spinach, chicken breast (chop it into chunks if it didn’t come chopped already), avocado and the orange segments.",
    "Add the dressing, tossing gently to coat. Sprinkle with spring onions and crushed peanuts. Wrap unsalted ones in a tea towel and give them a bash or buy pre-crushed from the cookery section of your supermarket. A bag of dry roasted isn’t really going to work here."
