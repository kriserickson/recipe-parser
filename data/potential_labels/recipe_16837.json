    "Note:.To cook beans you have 2 options: you can throw them in a crockpot (I usually cook mine this way but with at least double the amount of beans), cover with water by about 2 inches and cook on low all day. Or, soak beans over night in water to cover, rinse, add new water and boil on the stove for about two hours or until soft. Never add salt or acids (such as tomatoes) while cooking beans- it makes them very hard to cook. That includes most stocks! Add the flavors and salt at the end."
