    "To a mixing bowl, add ground chuck, 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce, chili powder, and salt and pepper to taste.",

    "Bring the burgers over to the hot side and sear each side a couple minutes each.",
    "Top with cheese and shut the lid, until the cheese melts.",
    "Serve onto toasted buns with extra barbecue sauce. Top with your favorite toppings! I added some beer battered jalapeno peppers. That’s it!",
    "Enjoy!"
