    "In a large pot, combine both sugars, corn starch, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and water. Bring to a boil while whisking over medium-high heat and let boil 2 minutes until thick and bubbly. Stir in apple slices and cover.",
    "Reduce heat to low and let simmer 10 minutes or until apples begin to soften. They do not need to be completely cooked! Remove from heat and cover. Let cool about 30-40 minutes, checking periodically. Your apples should be soft but not mushy.",
    "Ladle equal amounts into 4-5 freezer bags. I wanted my bags to be the same size as a can of apple pie filling tend to be around 21oz. so I put approx 2½ cups into each bag.",
    "Let cool on the counter and then freeze for up to one year."
