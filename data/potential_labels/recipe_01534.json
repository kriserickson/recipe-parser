    "In a medium bowl, toss the chicken with the scallion whites, half the garlic and ginger, soy sauce, sugar, 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch, 1/2 tablespoon Kosher salt, xiaoxing wine, and sesame oil. Marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes.",
    "In a small bowl, mix the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch with 1/2 cup water and set aside.",
    "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over high heat. Add the broccoli and the remaining garlic, ginger, 1/4 cup water, 1/4 teaspoon salt and chili garlic sauce. Stir-fry until the broccoli is bright green and tender-crisp, about 4 minutes, adding a tablespoon of water to prevent sticking. Transfer to a plate.",
    "Pour another 2 tablespoons oil in the pan and add the chicken mixture. Stir continuously until the chicken is brown and cooked through, 5-6 minutes. Add the oyster sauce, stir, then return the broccoli to the pan and toss to heat through. Stir in the reserved cornstarch mixture and bring to a boil to thicken (add a couple more tablespoons of water to make a bit more sauce, if desired.) Remove from heat and toss in the chopped scallion greens.",
    "Serve over white rice."
