    "Cook the bacon in a large, heavy-bottom soup pot over medium heat until it is crisp. Remove the bacon and reserve, and drain off all but 2 Tbsp of the remaining fat.",
    "Add the onion, celery and carrot and sauté over medium heat until the onion is almost translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef or pork and cook through, stirring often. Add the garlic and cook one minute more.",
    "Stir in the cabbage and add the tomatoes, stock, vinegar, horseradish, paprika, celery salt, bay leaves and rice and stir. Cover the pot and bring it up to a full simmer. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook the soup until the rice is fully cooked, about 40 minutes. Season to taste. Remove the bay leaves, add back the cooked bacon and serve garnished with a dollop of sour cream."
