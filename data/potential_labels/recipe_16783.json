    "Combine the coconut flour, almond butter, honey, and flaxseed in a medium bowl. Add a pinch of salt if your almond butter is unsalted.",
    "Using a wooden spoon, stir thoroughly to combine as best you can, then use your hands to incorporate the ingredients together completely.",
    "Divide the mixture into about 12 portions and roll into balls.",
    "Place the cocoa powder in a small bowl. One at a time, place a truffle into the bowl and roll it around gently to coat. Transfer each truffle to a plate once coated. When all truffles are coated, place the plate in the fridge to chill for 10-15 minutes. Enjoy!"
