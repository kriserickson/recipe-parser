    "Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375Â°F. Chop the cauliflower and its stem into bite-sized pieces. Place 1/2 of the cauliflower on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with the ghee or oil, toss to combine, and spread into an even layer. Roast until just golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, start the soup.",
    "Place the remaining cauliflower in a (4-quart) pot. Add the water, coconut milk, turmeric, salt, ginger, garlic, and pepper; stir to combine; and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover and simmer, reducing the heat as needed, until the cauliflower is tender, about 20 minutes.",
    "At this point, the roasted cauliflower should be done. Reserve what you'd like to keep crisp for topping the soup, then add the remaining roasted cauliflower to the pot. Remove from the heat and use an immersion blender to blend until smooth. (Alternatively, blend in batches in a regular blender.) Top with the reserved roasted cauliflower and serve."
