    "Make brownies. Let brownies cool completely.",
    "Make caramel then set aside to cool slightly.",
    "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Spread shredded coconut on a baking sheet then bake for 5-8 minutes, until browned. Remove and let cool. In a large bowl, mix together all of the caramel and coconut until completely combine. Pour mixture on top of brownies and push down with a rubber spatula.",
    "Melt chocolate then use a spoon to cascade, yes I said cascade, the chocolate across the coconut caramel topping. Any design will do.",
    "Lastly, sprinkle a couple pinches of flake salt on top of the brownies, as much or as little as you like. But remember that these brownies totally deserve the salt, it brings the flavor to a whole new level!",
    "Store in fridge or freezer!"
