    "Set a heavy-bottomed stock pot (like this one) over high heat. Toss in the mustard seeds, and cover the pot. Allow them to cook in the heat of the stove until you hear them popping, then immediately reduce the heat to medium-low, and stir in the butter. When the butter melts, stir in the leeks and carrots. Sprinkle the vegetables with salt, cover the pot again, and sweat them until the leeks soften and become tender - about 4 minutes.",
    "Increase the temperature to medium-high, pour in the chicken broth and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat. Blend with an immersion blender (I use this one.) until smooth, then stir in the milk. Adjust seasoning with additional salt as you like it, then ladle into soup bowls. Serve with a dollop of sour cream or homemade yogurt and a sprinkling of fresh chives."
