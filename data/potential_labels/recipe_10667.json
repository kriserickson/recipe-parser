    "To prepare the dressing: Whisk soy sauce, tea, rice vinegar, canola oil and sesame oil in a small bowl.",
    "To prepare the salad: Whisk mirin and ginger in a small bowl. Place steak in a shallow baking dish or pie pan. Pour mirin mixture over the steak; turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or for up to 2 hours, turning occasionally.",
    "Put a large pot of salted water on to boil for cooking noodles.",
    "Cook noodles in the boiling water until just tender, about 6 minutes. Drain; rinse under cold water. Transfer noodles to a large bowl. Add carrot and 1/3 cup of the Sesame-Soy Dressing; toss to coat.",
    "Preheat grill to medium-high.",
    "Lightly oil the grill rack by rubbing it with an oil-soaked paper towel (use tongs to hold the paper towel). Grill the steak for 4 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until it reaches desired doneness. (Alternatively, brush a little canola oil over a large skillet or ridged grill pan, preferably cast-iron, and heat over high heat. Add the steak and cook for 4 to 6 minutes per side.) Transfer the steak to a cutting board. Let rest for 5 minutes, then slice thinly against the grain.",
    "Build the salad on 4 plates starting with about 1 cup mixed greens, one-fourth of the noodle mixture, then one-fourth of the steak slices. Whisk remaining dressing again to combine, then drizzle about 4 teaspoons over each salad. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve immediately."
