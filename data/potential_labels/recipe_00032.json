    "Sift dry ingredients together. Mix in the 2 eggs.",
    "Slowly add the water and mix with a fork until the paste is able to form ribbons. Add more water as needed. The dough should be thinner than bread dough, but thicker than pancake batter.",
    "Bring a few inches worth of water to a boil in a large pot and add 1 Tbsp oil and a few shakes of salt.",
    "There are a few ways to add the spaetzle to the water:",
    "a) use a spaetzle cutter (these are available for about $10 on Amazon)",
    "b) place a large-holed colander over the pot of water and, using a spatula, press the batter through the holes in to the boiling water â€“ do this in batches, or work quickly as the batter on the bottom of the hot colander will start to cook onto the colander. Also, make sure there is enough water in the pot so that the spaetzle doesn't pile up on itself and clump up.",
    "c) Add about 1/3 of the batter on to a cutting board and, using a knife or spatula, slide thin ribbons of batter off the board in to the boiling water.",
    "5. Boil for approximately 2-3 minutes, until all the batter floats. Strain with a slotted spoon or hand held strainer and mix with a small amount of butter, or oil, to prevent sticking."
