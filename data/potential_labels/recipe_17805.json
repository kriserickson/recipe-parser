    "Stir cornstarch into cold water and set aside.",
    "Reduce the pressure using the rapid-release method. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken to a serving dish; cover with foil and set aside. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce, bring the mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce has thickened, about 3 minutes. Serve the chicken topped with the teriyaki sauce."
