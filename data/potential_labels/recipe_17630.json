    "In another bowl, mix the soup with the milk, stirring the milk in gradually so it’s smooth.",
    "Separate the crescent dough into the 8 triangles. Place about ¼ cup of the chicken mixture on the wide base of the crescent “triangle.” Roll up and seal completely–you roll these like you are making rolls, but also pinch the sides together so the filling is completely enclosed by the crescent dough.",
    "Place chicken-filled crescents in the pan making 2 rows with 4 crescents in each row–leave space on all sides for the sauce.",
    "Pour sauce around the crescents, avoiding covering the dough with the sauce or they will not brown and will be soggy!",
    "Sprinkle crescent tops with the grated Parmesan or Romano cheese.",
    "Bake for 30-35 minutes or until tops are nicely browned."
