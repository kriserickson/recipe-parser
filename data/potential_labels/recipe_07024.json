    "In a large skillet, render the chopped bacon until crispy, about 4 minutes. Add the onions, bell pepper and celery and cook until very tender and all the juices are evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with the Essence, salt, and pepper and set aside to cool.",
    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.",
    "Once the vegetables have cooled to room temperature, divide the bacon-vegetable mixture evenly between 6 individual shallow ramekins, about 1/3 cup for each ramekin. Divide the oysters evenly among the ramekins, laying the oysters the top of the vegetables in 1 even layer. Spoon 1/3 cup of the Dijon Creamed Spinach over the oysters in each ramekin, spreading with the back of a spoon to form an even layer. Top with the bread crumbs and Parmesan and bake until bubbly and golden brown on top, 22 to 25 minutes.",
    "Combine all ingredients thoroughly.",
    "Yield: 2/3 cup",
    "Recipe from \"New New Orleans Cooking\", by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch; Published by William Morrow, 1993.",
    "In a large skillet, cook the onions with the olive oil until almost translucent. Sprinkle the onions with the flour and add garlic, thyme, and bay leaf, and cook for 2 minutes. Add mustard and cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the heavy cream and whisk to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and cook until sauce is thick and creamy, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and white pepper, to taste. Add the spinach, stir until thoroughly combined, and serve.",
