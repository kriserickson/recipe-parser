    "Whisk together all the marinade ingredients in a small bowl. Pour half the marinade mixture on the beef and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes, or up to 8 hours. Refrigerate the second half of the marinade as well.",
    "When you're ready to cook the dish, heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Remove the beef from its marinade with a slotted spoon, and add it to the pan. Sear until browned, turning once or twice so that all sides cook evenly, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer the beef to a separate plate with a slotted spoon and set aside. In the hot pan, add the white onions and stir fry for 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Add the bean sprouts and stir-fry an additional 1 minute.",
    "Add the second half of the marinade, the noodles and the beef to the pan. Stir fry for 1 minute, tossing occasionally to combine. Add the green onions and sesame oil and stir fry for 1 more minute, tossing occasionally to combine. Season with additional salt and white pepper (and Sriracha) if needed.",
