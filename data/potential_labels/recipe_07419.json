    "Method Remove the stalks from the cauliflower and cut into large florets. In a pan of boiling water, add the cauliflower and cook for five minutes. When ready, drain from the water and place back in the pan. Cover so it stays warm.",
    "While the cauliflower is cooking, cut the onions into small pieces. Squash the garlic with the back of a knife to make it easier to peel. Chop until nice and fine.",
    "In a pan, add a touch of butter, plus the onion, garlic and ginger, and sauté until golden brown.",
    "In the same pan, add the dried spices and cook for a further five minutes.",
    "Add the tin of tomatoes and chickpeas and stir well. Then add the cooked cauliflower. Top up with 100ml of cold water and bring to a simmer for five to 10 minutes until the cauliflower is cooked.",
    "Finish by adding the chopped coriander. Serve on a warm plate."
