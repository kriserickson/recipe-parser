    "To make the sauce, whisk together chicken stock, honey, soy sauce, lemon juice and lemon zest. Set aside.",
    "In a wok or frying pan heat 1 and a half tbs coconut oil and add the prawns. Season with a little salt and pepper and cook until just turned pink, but slightly undercooked. It is important not to cook them too much yet because you will be adding them back to the vegetables later. Pull prawns out and set aside on a plate.",
    "Heat the rest of the oil in the same frying pan and add broccoli and snow peas, cooking until tender-crisp and bright green. About 2-3 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic, cooking for an extra 30 seconds.",
    "Pour in the sauce mixture to the same pan. Add the prawns back in. Simmer for about a minute, until the sauce has thickened.",
    "Serve with quinoa, brown rice or noodles."
