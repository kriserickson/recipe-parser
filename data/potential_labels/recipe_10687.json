    "Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on the bottom bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.",
    "Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in the pan, and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than the burger bun.",
    "Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until well-browned and top is beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape burger patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.",
    "Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over one patty and stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve."
