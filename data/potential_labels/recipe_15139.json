    "Mix the flour, baking powder, salt and a little of the milk to a smooth paste. Add the remaining milk gradually, while whisking. Add the egg, beating the mixture well. For a lighter texture, leave to rest for a few hours or overnight.",
    "Melt the butter and oil in a large frying pan and wait until it sizzles. Pour in enough of the mixture to cover the entire surface of the pan (spread the mixture evenly by tilting the pan). Bake until bubbles appear on the surface and turn over. Pancakes should be pale gold on both sides. Set aside."
