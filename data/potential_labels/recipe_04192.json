    "Preheat the oven to 200Â°C and bring a saucepan of water to the boil, ready for stage two. Mix together one tablespoon extra virgin olive oil with the crushed garlic, most of the juice from the lemon, dill and two tablespoons of water. Coat the salmon fillets in the mixture. Place the fillets on a baking tray, seal with foil and bake for 10 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, rinse the quinoa under cold water. Add to a saucepan of boiling water. Bring back to the boil, then cover and simmer for five minutes. Add the onion and cumin seeds. Simmer for five more minutes or until the quinoa grains split. Remove from heat and stir in one tablespoon olive oil and the chopped coriander.",
    "Halve the tomatoes and mix them with the rocket and balsamic vinegar, one tablespoon of olive oil and a splash of lemon juice. Remove the salmon and serve on the salad and quinoa. This is the right kind of rocket fuel for your body."
