    "Shake the can of coconut milk as it can settle. In a medium-sized saucepan, bring half the can of coconut milk, sugar, and salt to a simmer over low heat. Don't allow it to boil fully.",
    "In a separate small bowl, whisk together the remaining coconut milk, cornstarch, cocoa powder, and espresso powder.",
    "Slowly add the cornstarch mixture to the hot pan of coconut milk, whisking vigorously. Keep whisking on low heat until the pudding almost reaches a simmer once again and begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.",
    "Remove the saucepan from heat. Whisk in the chocolate and vanilla. Keep stirring until the chocolate melts into the pudding and the mixture is smooth and silky.",
    "Pour pudding in a separate bowl and place in the refrigerator to chill thoroughly, at least 2 hours. To prevent a skin from forming, press plastic wrap up against the surface of the pudding.",
    "Serve with a dusting of toasted coconut flakes. If covered in an airtight container, pudding can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. It will firm up quite a bit once chilled; give it a good, firm stir before serving."
