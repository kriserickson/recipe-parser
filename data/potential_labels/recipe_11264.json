    "In a large skillet, heat the butter and olive oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the garlic and cook until just fragrant (about 1 minute). Reduce the heat to medium, add the onions, and cook until very soft and beginning to caramelize, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.",
    "Add the tomato paste, diced tomatoes, and reserved 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water. Season with salt and pepper and cook over medium-high heat until the sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. If it looks too dry, add some water.",
    "Stir in the sour cream.",
    "Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss to combine. Add the grated cheese; toss well.",
    "Divide the pasta equally among bowls and top with the chopped parsley, plus extra grated cheese, if you like."
