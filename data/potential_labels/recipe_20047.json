    "If there is a chalky film on the kombu, avoid wiping or washing it off; the film contains flavorful natural glutamates. Combine the kombu and water in a large pot and set aside for at least 20 minutes or cover and refrigerate overnight.",

    "Heat the pot over medium heat until it comes to a bare simmer. Remove from heat and scatter bonito flakes over the top; let stand for 5 minutes. Remove the kombu using tongs and reserve for another use, such as slicing for a salad or soup.",

    "Line a sieve with cheesecloth and place over a large bowl. Strain the stock."
