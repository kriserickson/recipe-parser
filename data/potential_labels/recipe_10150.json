    "Melt the coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat and sauté the onions, carrots, and celery until tender, about 8 minutes.",
    "Add in the minced garlic and sauté another minute, just until fragrant.",
    "Add in the cumin, ginger, turmeric, salt, lentils, quinoa, water, and tomatoes and bring the soup to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and cover the pot to let everything simmer until the lentils are tender, about 20 minutes.",
    "Once the lentils and vegetables are very tender, stir in the chopped kale and cook until it's wilted, just a few minutes. Season with additional salt, if desired, (I added a ½ teaspoon myself) and serve warm.",
    "Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for up to 4 days, and I think this would make a great packed lunch in a thermos for the week, too!"
