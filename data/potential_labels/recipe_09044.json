    "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots, onion and celery and saute 3 minutes. Add green beans and saute 3 minutes longer. Add zucchini and garlic and saute 1 more minute. Pour in broth and tomatoes. Add basil, rosemary, thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to medium and allow to boil 8 minutes. Add tortellini and boil 5-7 minutes longer (or 2 minutes less than directions listed on package. If a more brothy soup is desired, then boil pasta separately from soup then add at the end). Stir in spinach and cook 2 minutes longer.",
