    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.",
    "Add chicken to a large bowl, mix in apple and leeks. Stir in remaining ingredients, and work together with a large spoon or your hands, just until mixture is combined. You donâ€™t want to overwork the meat. Form mixture into 2-inch meatballs (a heaping tablespoon), then place evenly on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn meatballs over so both sides brown and bake for another 10 minutes, until meatballs are no longer pink on the inside.",
    "While meatballs are baking, heat oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Stir in leeks, ginger, nutmeg and salt. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until leeks are softened. Stir in honey, squash and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 12 to 14 minutes, until squash has softened and you can pierce through with a fork. Add soup mixture to blender (or use a hand blender) and puree until smooth.",
    "Serve soup with one or two meatballs added to the middle of the bowl. Both can be made a day in advance, then rewarmed.",
    "Tip: If you have time, roasting the squash will impart an even deeper flavor."
