    "Set to jam cycle and run. This will produce well-toasted but not burnt granola. If you like it a little less toasted, simply take it out before the time is up. One can, of course add dried fruit, but it is often best to do this after the cycle is finished: some dried fruit will turn hard in this cycle. One can also add a few tablespoons of orange juice concentrate if one wishes for an orangy flavor. This is an ideal variation if one is planning to add Craisins sweetened dried cranberries at the end.",
    "If one craves crispy, lumpy granola then one must add some flour and some water or fruit juice. Add 1/2 cup of flour that has been mixed with 1/4 tsp baking soda. And add a quarter cup of fruit juice concentrate . If lumps are the goal, add the butter toward the end of the cycle. Or, one can simply load it up with honey.",
