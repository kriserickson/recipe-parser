    "To the canister of a blender, add the strawberries, bananas, and about 1/2 cup juice. Add enough juice only as necessary to get blender moving and until desired smoothie consistency is reached.",
    "Blend on high power until smooth and creamy. The longer you blend, the fluffier the mixture tends to become due to the bananas.",
    "Pour mixture into 2 glasses and serve immediately. Extra portion will keep airtight in the freezer for up to 1 month (cover a freezer-safe glass with plasticwrap or place inside a ziplock to prevent freezer smells). Allow to come up to room temp for about 30 minutes before serving."
