Add buttermilk to dry ingredients, stirring until dry ingredients are moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead lightly 4 to 5 times. Roll or pat dough out to about 1-inch thickness. Cut with a biscuit cutter and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for about 12 to 14 minutes or until brown."
