    "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip the tomatoes, peppers, olives, cinnamon and herbs into a pan, cover and simmer for 10 mins until the tomatoes have broken down a little. Add the tuna and season.",
    "Tip the cream cheese into a bowl, season and mix to loosen a little, adding a splash of water (or milk, if you have some) to make a thick white-sauce consistency. Assemble the lasagne in a baking dish, approx 20 x 30cm. Pour roughly a third of the tuna sauce into the bottom of the dish, top with 4 lasagne sheets, a third of the cream cheese sauce, then repeat the layers twice more. Scatter over the mozzarella and bake for 35 mins until golden and bubbling."
