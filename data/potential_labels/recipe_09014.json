    "Using a cheese cloth or a fine sift, drain any excess liquid out of the ricotta cheese. Separate the egg whites from the yolks.",
    "Sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Whisk together the ricotta cheese, milk, egg yolks, and vanilla in a large bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the ricotta mixture and stir gently until combined, try not to over mix it.",
    "Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Stir 1/4 of the egg whites into the pancake batter to lighten it up, then gently fold in the remaining whites using a spatula.",
    "Melt a small knob of butter on a frying pan or cast iron griddle over medium-high heat. Fill a ladle with 3/4 of batter and pour it onto the hot pan/griddle. Cook the pancakes for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Repeat with the remaining batter."
