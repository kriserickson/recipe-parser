    "Method",
    "Blanch for a minute, drain, squeeze out as much water as possible, then chop. In a bowl, mix 500g of dry ricotta (Brancourt's is good), the chopped spinach, 100g of finely grated parmesan, 4 eggs, a pinch of grated nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. Using a little flour on your hands, shape each gnocchi into a \"torpedo\" about 5-6cm long and 2cm in diameter. In a large pot of salted water, poach the gnocchi for 3-4 minutes - they should rise to the surface when ready. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain well.",
    "To serve",
    "Spoon gnocchi in a serving dish, sprinkle with generous amounts of grated parmesan and finish with nut-brown (burnt) butter."
