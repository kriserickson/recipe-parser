    "We used a slow cooker for this recipe, which will take approx. 6 hours. If using stove top just use the lowest heat available to simmer, timings will have to be adjusted. It is ready when meat is tender.",
    "Preheat 1 tbsp. olive oil and brown meat, approx. 4 mins, spoon onto plate and set aside.",
    "Heat remaining olive oil, 1 tbsp, and sauté onion, approx. 5 mins or until softened. Add Beef back to pan and with garlic, paprika, Worcestershire sauce and barley. Sauté 1 min.",
    "Add beef stock and 2 cups water, thyme and pepper. Simmer for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.",
    "After 3 hours, add potato and carrot. You will need to add more water as the barley would have soaked up a lot of the liquid. Simmer a further 2 hours.",
    "Now add mushrooms, a little more water might be needed. Taste, you can add more pepper and thyme or garlic to suit your taste. Simmer a further hour.",
    "Serve or leave until next day so flavours all incorporate."
