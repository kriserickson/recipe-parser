    "For the crispy tofu: Cut the tofu in cubes. Add the all-purpose flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the tofu to the bowl and toss carefully until all the tofu cubes are coated. Bring a large pan with canola oil to high heat, toss in the tofu. Let it cook on each side until browned and crispy. Remove the tofu from the pan and set aside.",
    "Wash and cut the broccoli. Peel and cube the sweet potato.",
    "In a small pot add water, cook the sweet potato until soft. Steam the broccoli on top.",
    "Add the drained sweet potato, broccoli, and fresh spinach to a large pan on medium heat. Leave it to cook on medium heat until the spinach has wilted. Then lower the heat and add in the coconut milk and curry paste. Mix well so that the curry paste dissolves. Heat until all warmed up. Add salt to taste and the crispy tofu.",
