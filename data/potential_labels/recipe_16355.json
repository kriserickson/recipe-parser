    "In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend the flour, yeast, and salt. Add the water and, with a wooden spoon or your hands, mix thoroughly.",
    "2",
    "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow it to rise at room temperature for 18 hours or until it has more than doubled. It will take longer in a chilly room and less time in a very warm one.",
    "3",
    "Flour a work surface and scrape out the dough. Divide it into 4 equal parts and shape them. For each portion, start with the right side of the dough and pull it towards the center; then do the same with the left, then the top, then the bottom (the order doesn’t actually matter; what you want is four folds). Shape each portion into a round and turn seam side down. Mold the dough into a neat circular mound. The mounds should not be sticky; if they are, dust with more flour.",
    "4",
    "If you don’t intend to use the dough right away, wrap the balls individually in plastic and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Return to room temperature by leaving them out on the counter, covered in a damp cloth, for 2 to 3 hours before needed.",

    "Add a 28-ounce can of whole San Marzano tomatoes. Stir in and lightly break up the tomatoes. Add some dry onion powder along with some dry oregano, stir to combine and let simmer for 30-45 minutes.",

    "Slowly start to pat the dough down into the general shape of a pizza. Don’t roll it out with a rolling pin. Once the dough had grown in size, pass over your knuckles and slowly start to spread it out until a pizza pie shape is formed.",
    "11",
    "Add your sauce and low moisture mozzarella along with whatever toppings you’d like and place on your pizza stone in your preheated 500°F oven (pre-heat for 1 hour). Bake for 7-9 minutes.",
