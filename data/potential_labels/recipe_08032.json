    "How To Make It:",
    "1. Prepare a regular-sized muffin tin by greasing it with coconut oil.",
    "1. To make the crust. Add the dates and almonds into a food processor and blend until finely chopped. The mixture should begin to stick together and form a dough. Scoop a heaping tablespoon into each muffin tin and, using your fingers or the bottom of a drinking glass, firmly press the mixture down until it completely sticks together.",
    "2. To make the filling. Wipe out your food processor and add the cashews, coconut cream, maple syrup, and cup coconut oil. Blend until creamy and smooth. Pour the mixture into the tins over the mini crusts. Place in the freezer for 4-6 hours.",
    "3. To make the caramel sauce. While the cheesecakes are freezing, prepare the caramel sauce by adding the coconut palm sugar, coconut milk, honey, and butter into a large glass mixing glass. Microwave for 3-4 minutes, stirring every minute, until the sugar has completely melted. (Be careful not to overcook it, because it will boil over.) Allow the sauce to cool at room temperature until the cheesecakes have hardened.",
    "4. Remove the cheesecakes from the muffin tins and drizzle the caramel sauce over the cheesecake bites and enjoy!"
