    "In a medium cast iron skillet, bring butter and cream to a simmer over medium heat. Add chocolate; reduce to medium-low. Cook, stirring constantly, until chocolate has melted, about 1 minute. Remove from heat, and let cool 5 minutes.",
    "Add chocolate mixture to sugar mixture, whisking until blended (reserve skillet). Fold in flour mixture. Pour batter into skillet.",
    "Updated* Bake for about 25 minutes. (Check brownie at 20 minutes for a gooey er consistency* Oven temperatures vary, and since your cast iron skillet holds heat for quite some time, your brownie will continue to bake if left to rest. For those of you that want a cookie/cake like consistency you may want to let it sit for a bit)",
    "Serve immediately from skillet",
    "But be careful, it's hot!",
    "For an even more decadent treat, serve with ice cream & strawberries!"
