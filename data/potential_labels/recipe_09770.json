    "Place the essential ingredients in the crockpot. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3 hours.",
    "Shred the chicken directly in the crockpot to your desired texture. Add the extras, if you want, and cover and cook for another 20-30 minutes. This is also a great time to make your rice, if you're serving it with rice. When everything is ready, taste the chicken mixture and season with salt. Serve the creole chicken over rice and topped with green onions."
