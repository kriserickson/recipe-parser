    "Add the spices and salt once the water is boiling, then continue to cook until the onions are very soft.",
    "Then, remove the pan from the heat and blend the mixture until it is smooth - using either an immersion blender or a free-standing blender (if you use a free-standing blender you'll want to allow the mixture to cool slightly)",
    "This is then your curry base gravy! Allow to cool, then portion up into 6 sandwich bags / tubs and store until you want to use it."
