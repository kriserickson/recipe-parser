    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut a pocket into the side of each chicken breast. Drizzle chicken with olive oil and add the paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, and onion powder to a small bowl then stir to combine. Sprinkle evenly over both sides of the chicken then add cream cheese, Parmesan, mayonnaise, garlic, and remaining ½ teaspoon of salt to a small mixing bowl and stir well to combine. Stir in the broccoli. Spoon the cheese mixture into each chicken breast evenly. Slice each piece of bacon in half and wrap each piece of chicken with 2 pieces of bacon. Place the chicken breasts in a 9 x 13 baking dish. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Place pan under the broiler to crisp the bacon more, if desired."
