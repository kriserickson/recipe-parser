    "Mix all the stuffing ingredients in a bowl until well combined. Shape into ‘sausages’ and place onto each steak. Roll up to make large hearty parcels and secure with wooden skewers or string to hold the stuffing in.",
    "To cook, heat the dripping or oil in a cooking pot over a medium heat and brown off the beef olives. Once done, fry the onions, whole carrots until well coloured, then add the beef stock and wine. Cook gently, either on the hob or in the oven (preheated to 170°C/Gas mark 3), for 2½–3 hours until tender and giving. Serve hot, with creamy mash or just thick slices of bread and butter."
