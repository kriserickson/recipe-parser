    "In a large, nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, add canola oil and let it heat. Once oil is hot, add potatoes and press into a single layer. Cook without disturbing — except to press down more — for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the bottom of the layer develops a golden brown crust. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "After the crust forms, flip the potatoes — stir or flip, they will not really stick together enough to completely flip — and stir in the onion and white parts of scallions. Cook on the other side, with the onion for another 3 minutes.",
    "Once both sides have browned and the onion is softened, stir in chicken and green chilies. Cover and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then stir, and cook for another 2 minutes, or until all ingredients are hot and cooked together. Taste for seasoning.",
    "Serve hash hot, topped with scallions and avocado."
