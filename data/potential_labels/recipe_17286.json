    "In a saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the scallions and ginger and sauté until soft and toasted in spots, about 2 minutes.",
    "Add the kimchi, the rice, and 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, adding more water if necessary, until the rice is broken down and the porridge is the desired consistency (some like their porridge soupy, others thicker with most of the liquid absorbed), 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "Turn off the heat and stir in the kimchi brine. Season with salt and more kimchi brine to taste.",
    "To serve, fry eggs to your liking. Top each bowl of porridge with an egg, chopped scallions and a drizzle of sesame oil."
