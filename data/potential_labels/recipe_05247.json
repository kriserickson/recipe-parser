    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "Arrange the wonton strips in a single layer (or as best you can get them) on a greased baking sheet. Spray the wontons with olive oil spray and a good sprinkle of sea salt. Bake in the preheated oven for 5-10 minutes, watching them closely to make sure they don't burn. They are done when they are a light golden color and crisp. Remove from the oven and set aside.",
    "In a small sauce pot mix together 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1 teaspoon cornstarch until smooth. Add 1/4 cup pineapple juice, 1/4 cup honey and 1 teaspoon chile garlic sauce. Place the pot on the stove over medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer 3-4 minutes until the sauce is just beginning to thicken and coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat.",
    "Heat a large cast iron skillet on high and add the sesame oil. Sear the tuna steaks in the skillet for 1-2 minutes, flip and brush the seared side with the soy sauce mixture. Sear another minute or 2 and then remove the steaks from the pan, brushing them with the remaining soy sauce mixture. Slice into strips.",
    "Combine the spring greens, cilantro, pineapple chunks and jalape√±o (or red chile) in a bowl and toss.",
    "In another small bowl make the vinaigrette. Combine the hot chile sesame oil, soy sauce, pineapple juice, rice vinegar, chile garlic sauce, tahini, 1 teaspoon lime zest and the juice of 1 lime, the fresh ginger and garlic. Add 1-2 tablespoons black and white sesame seeds.",
    "Divide the greens among plates. Top with tuna, avocado slices and wonton crisps. Drizzle with the vinaigrette. Dig in!"
