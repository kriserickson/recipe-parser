    "Rub the beef with salt and pepper, place in a covered skillet, and cover with water. Stew it until it is brown.",
    "Remove the ends from the green beans. Cut them into 1 1/2 inch pieces.",
    "When the beef is finished, remove one cup of the broth and reserve it. Put the green beans in alongside it, and stew them until they are cooked to your taste.",
    "Chop tomatoes and food-process with the beef broth and crushed garlic until smooth. Add this mixture to the green beans and beef. Salt and pepper generously, and add about 2 teaspoons each of cumin and coriander. Let it simmer for about an hour. For the most delicious flavor, let it sit on the stove for a while after that hour and reheat later."
