    "In a small bowl, bloom the gelatin with the cold water. Measure out 2 tablespoons of the mango puree and mix it with the granulated sugar. Microwave the mango and sugar mixture for 40-45 seconds until the mixture is warm and the sugar has dissolved. Mix the bloomed gelatin into the warm mixture until fully incorporated and mix it with the rest of the mango puree. Whip the heavy cream until soft peaks and slowly and gently fold the whipped cream into the mango puree mixture. Once fully incorporated divide into 4 serving cups and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight until set. Serve with fresh diced mango. Enjoy!"
