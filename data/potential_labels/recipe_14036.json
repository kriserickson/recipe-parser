    "Directions",
    "Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF and place a rack in the middle of the oven. Butter the inside of a 8 to 9-inch cast iron skillet.",
    "Finely chop two of the pears and thinly slice the two other.",
    "Sift together the flour, baking powder, ginger and salt in a bowl.",
    "In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and sugar together on medium speed for about 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and almond extract and blend on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the bowl if needed.",
    "Turn the mixer to low speed and add the flour mixture all at once. Mix until just blended. The batter will be stiff. Turn the mixer off.",
    "Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chopped pears, and stir just until blended.",
    "Pour the batter into the prepared skillet and spread it in an even layer. Arrange the pear slices on top of the batter and sprinkle with the sliced almonds.",
    "Bake until the cake is golden in color and the center springs back when lightly touched, about 40 minutes."
