    "Divide the meat mixture into 15-18 evensized pieces and shape into balls (they should be about the size of a walnut). Always wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw meat so you don’t transfer any germs that may be on the meat to other food or equipment.",
    "Heat the oil in the frying pan over a medium heat and add the meatballs using a spoon. Cook them for 5 mins, turning until golden brown. Remove from the pan and place them on to the tray. Bake in the oven for 15-20 mins.",
    "Remove from the oven. Remember to use oven gloves! Allow to cool slightly and serve with a fresh, crisp green salad, some pitta bread and tomato salsa."
