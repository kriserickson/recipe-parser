    "Mince 1 whole scallion, transfer to a bowl, and whisk in 2 tablespoons oil and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set scallion sauce aside. Put the remaining scallions on a plate. Drizzle with remaining oil and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat a large cast-iron grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook scallions, turning occasionally, until tender and slightly charred, about 5 minutes. Divide scallions between plates.",
    "Pour 1/2 cup water into each of two 8-ounce microwave-safe coffee cups. Crack 1 egg into each cup, making sure it's completely submerged. Cover each with a saucer. Microwave 1 egg on high until white is set but yolk is runny, about 1 minute (cooking time will vary depending on microwave). Uncover; using a slotted spoon, transfer egg to top of 1 serving of scallions. Dress with half of the scallion sauce. Repeat with remaining egg and sauce; serve.",
