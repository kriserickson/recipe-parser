    "NOTE–I used reduced-fat biscuits. Also reduced-fat sausage or turkey sausage may be substituted",
    "Brown sausage meat, breaking up lumps. Drain and set aside.",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut each biscuit into quarters. Place HALF of the cut up biscuits on the bottom of a 1.5 quart casserole dish.",
    "Bake for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare sausage gravy by melting butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan. Add flour (make a roux) and whisk so there are no lumps. Cook roux over medium heat about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. While whisking, add milk slowly, making sure there are no lumps. Add salt and pepper. Cook sauce until it begins to thicken. Add cooked sausage.",
    "Remove baking dish with partially-baked biscuits from the oven. Pour sausage gravy on top of biscuit crust. Place remaining biscuits on top of the casserole; return to oven and bake an additional 25-30 minutes, or until top biscuits are golden brown."
