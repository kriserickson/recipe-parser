    "Heat up a skillet (cast-iron preferred) and add the olive oil. Saute the garlic until slightly browned, then add the clams. Stir a few times before adding the white wine and tomatoes. Cook the clams until they are all open, add the salt, lemon juice and chopped parsley. Stir to combine well. Turn off the heat, garnish with the lemon wedges and serve immediately."
