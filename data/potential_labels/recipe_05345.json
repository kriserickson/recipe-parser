    "Place 3/4 cup water in a pot and bring to a boil before adding in all the other ingredients, and cover with a lid. This should be allowed to simmer for about 5-10 minutes, or until the apples are tender.",
    "Depending on what you are using this for you can either mash it all together with a fork and let cool before serving it, and this makes a great apple marmalade. If using this in a recipe or as a sauce, blend it using a hand blender (or standard blender) after it is cooked.",
    "Add the remaining 1/4 cup water if necessary to get the smooth creamy consistency."
