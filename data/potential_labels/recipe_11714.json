    "Get a prime rib roast at your supermarket. It’s usually labeled bone-in ribeye roast.",
    "Mix up equal parts of onion salt, seasoned salt, and garlic powder. Approx 1/4 cup total.",
    "Pat the salt mixture on both ends and the fat side of the roast. The salt may not stick as well on the fat side. Don’t worry about it.",
    "Pre-heat oven as high as it will go. Usually 500 degrees, but NOT broil.",
    "Stick the roast in a roasting pan, preferably on a small rack that will lift it off the bottom. Bone side down (fat side up). Get a meat thermometer and stick it in the middle of the roast.",
    "Cook the roast in the oven for 5-6 minutes per pound and then shut the oven off.",
    "DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR FOR TWO HOURS UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH.",
    "7. After two hours take it out and check the temp. If its 140 degrees it’s perfect. If it’s cooler, put it back in the oven at 375 degrees until it hits 140 degrees.",
    "8. This procedure will yield a PERFECT MEDIUM RARE PRIME RIB. (Don’t ask me how to do medium or well done because cooking prime rib roast past medium rare is a felony.)",
    "9. Get a package of Au Jus mix in the spice section of your supermarket and make following directions."
