    "Add the chopped tomato and spring onion to the hot oily pan along with the chopped chilli, turning everything about for a minute or so with a wooden spoon.",
    "Put the corn tortilla strips back in the pan, and add the beaten eggs and salt. Using the same spoon, move everything about the pan as you do when scrambling eggs.",
    "Once the eggs are setting, remove the pan from the heat, and continue stirring the eggs until they are done to your liking."
