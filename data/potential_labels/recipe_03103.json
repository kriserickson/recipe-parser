    "Preheat a Dutch oven over medium heat and add the oil. Next, add the onion and sauté until tender, about 8-10 minutes. Add the garlic and jalapeños and sauté until just tender, about 2-3 minutes. Add the ground meat and seasonings and cook until the meat is just browned through, about 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Deglaze the pot by adding the beer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a spoon. Finally, add the tomato purée, diced tomatoes, and beans. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer partially covered for 30-45 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve with desired toppings."
