    "Thinly spread 1/3 of the tuna mixture onto half of the bread lengthwise.",
    "On top of the tuna mixture, arrange some of the cucumber sticks and grated carrot making sure not too over stuff the roll (a little goes a long way).",
    "Starting at the side closest to you (the filled end) tightly roll the tuna/cucumber/carrot mixture up and press to seal into a roll (I dab a bit of mayonnaise across the end of the roll to act as a glue sealing the roll).",
    "Cut the roll into 4 even pieces and repeat with remaining bread and tuna mixture.",
    "Serve."
