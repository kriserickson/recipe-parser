    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.",
    "On a baking sheet, toss the carrots and garlic cloves with 1 tablespoon olive oil and the cumin, salt and pepper. Roast until the carrots are tender and lightly caramelized, stirring halfway through, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool until warm. Peel the garlic cloves.",
    "In a food processor, combine the roasted carrots and garlic with the tahini, cilantro, lemon juice and 5 tablespoons water. Pulse until smooth. With the processor running, slowly add 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil. Transfer to a serving bowl. Make a small well in the center of the hummus and fill with olive oil. Sprinkle the remaining 1 teaspoon cilantro over the top. Serve with crudites and pita chips."
