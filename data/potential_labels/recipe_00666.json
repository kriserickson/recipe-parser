    "Place chicken, 1 onion, tomato, carrot, and 2 cloves of garlic into crock pot. Add just enough water to cover, add bay leaves and salt and cook high for 4 hours until the chicken is tender. When done, remove chicken and shred with two forks; set aside. Reserve the broth.",

    "In a large deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the remaining garlic, onions, green peppers, and red peppers. Cook about 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft. Stir in the cooked chicken, tomato sauce, white wine, and about 3/4 cup of the reserved broth to create a sauce. Season with cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cover and simmer on low for about 8 to 10 minutes, adding more broth and seasoning if needed. Makes 4 cups."
