    "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean-up.",
    "Cut the broccoli into 2-inch florets, leaving one to two inches of stems attached. Discard the remaining thick stalks. In a large bowl, combine the melted butter, garlic, chipotle chili peppers, honey and salt and mix well. Add the broccoli and toss to coat evenly. Transfer the broccoli to the prepared baking sheet.",
    "Roast for about 12 minutes, until the broccoli is crisp-tender and lightly browned in spots. Sprinkle lime juice over top (go easy; a little goes a long way). Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Transfer the broccoli to a serving dish. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the bits of garlic and chipotle chili peppers off the foil and onto the broccoli. Serve hot."
