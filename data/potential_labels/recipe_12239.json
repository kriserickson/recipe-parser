    "Mix the flour and salt in a food processor.",
    "Add the butter and pulse",
    "Add the egg and the water or milk (in small increments) and continue pulsing until a clumpy dough forms.",
    "To make the empanada dough by hand, follow the same instruction but use your hands to mix the ingredients together.",
    "Split the dough into 2 large ball, flatten slightly into the shape of disks. The dough can be used immediately or refrigerated until ready to use (1-2 days max).",
    "Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut out round disc shapes for empanadas (use round molds or a small plate). You can also make small individual balls with the dough and roll out each individual ball to a round shape (doesn't need to be perfectly round) - if you have a tortilla press you can use it to flatten the dough balls.",
    "Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator/freezer to use later."
