    "Over medium heat in a thick bottomed saucepan, combine the oil, red onions, bell peppers and jalapenos. Cook until softened. Add the ground beef and pork. Cook through, breaking the meat into small chunks as it browns. Add the garlic and cook for 5 minutes. Drain any excess fat as necessary. Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, vinegar, wine, Worcestershire, sugar, paprika, salt, black pepper, cayenne, cumin and mustard. Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 30 minutes.",
