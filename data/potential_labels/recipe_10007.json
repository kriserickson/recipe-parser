    "Note: This salad is best made just prior to serving. Prepare one hour or less before your meal.",
    "Cut rind from the watermelon, then chop the fruit into 1 inch chunks. Place chunks in a colander to drain as your chop.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, fresh lime juice, salt, and black pepper to create a dressing.",
    "Place watermelon in a large salad bowl. Pour dressing and chopped mint over the watermelon and toss gently to coat.",
    "Pour the crumbled feta into the salad bowl and stir gently to integrate the cheese into the salad. Serve.",
    "The salt and the citrus in the dressing will activate the juices in the watermelon, so a lot of liquid will collect in the bottom of the salad bowl. This is normal, and does not affect the flavor. To avoid having liquid transfer to your plate, serve the salad with a slotted spoon."
