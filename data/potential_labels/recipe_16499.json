    "Separate the rice cakes (if they are stuck to each other). If they were kept in the fridge, soak them in warm/hot water for 10 to 20 mins to soften.",
    "Heat the wok on high heat and add some oil. Add all the prepared ingredients together and stir them occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium half way through.",
    "Once all ingredients are cooked serve them with some steamed rice."
