    "In a large zip top bag place all marinade ingredients in and mix together.",
    "Place fish in bag and close tight. I would recommend putting the bag or bags in a dish so it doesn’t leak in the fridge.",
    "Allow to marinate for 2-4 hrs.",
    "When you are ready to cook place the fish on the planks and on the grill over low heat and cook until just firm to the touch or desired doneness.",
    "If you have an instant read thermometer about 120-125 degrees for a rarer salmon and up to 145 for more well done. But trust me when I say this fish is so good you don’t want to over cook it!",
    "Enjoy!"
