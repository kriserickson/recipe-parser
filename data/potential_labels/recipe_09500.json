    "Flip the chicken over.",
    "Cover and cook for another 15 minutes.",
    "Pop the lid up so that steam can escape, allowing the apple juice to reduce down.",
    "Cook for another 10-20 minutes until the juice is thick and syrupy, turning the chicken every 10 minutes or so.",
    "Watch it closely for the last 2-3 minutes, as it can burn quickly.",
    "Remove from heat once the chicken is cooked through and the juice resembles honey in consistency."
