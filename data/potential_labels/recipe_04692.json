    "Heat the butter in a large pot over medium high heat. Add the onions and potatoes and saute until golden brown, 5-8 minutes, sprinkling with salt and pepper. Add 6 cups of the broth and the kale; simmer for 5-10 minutes until the kale softens and becomes a darker green.",
    "Transfer the soup to a heavy-duty blender. Puree for 2-3 minutes or until the soup is completely smooth. Transfer the pureed soup back the pan and stir in the milk and the remaining 2 cups broth depending on how thick you want the soup to be. Season with salt and pepper and serve with yummy paninis, toasted wheat bread, or crackers, cheese, and hummus."
