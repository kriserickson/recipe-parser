    "Sprinkle both sides of the chicken evenly with the salt and set aside until the salt draws out some moisture from the chicken. Use paper towels to pat the chicken dry.",
    "Place the chicken skin-side down in a cold non-stick frying pan and turn the heat on to medium. If you are using skinless chicken, you will need to add a bit of oil to the pan.",
    "Fry the chicken on one side until the skin is crisp and browned. Flip the chicken over and continue frying until the chicken is almost cooked through.",
    "Drain off any excess oil and then use paper towels to wipe up any remaining oil.",
    "Add the soy sauce, sugar and sake and turn the heat up to high. Use tongs to continuously flip the chicken to keep basting it with the teriyaki sauce.",
    "The chicken teriyaki is done when there is almost no liquid remaining in the pan, and the chicken is coated in a thick, shiny glaze."
