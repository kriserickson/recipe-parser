    "Boil the potatoes in a large pot of salted water until tender, about 15-20 min. depending on size. Drain and cool slightly. Place the hot potatoes between a clean tea towel folded over and press down to smash lightly. Place the potatoes in a 8x8\" pan in a checker board pattern using half of the potatoes. Spread ½ cup of the light sour cream on top of the potatoes. Top with ½ of the bacon and ½ of the green onion. Sprinkle with 1½ cups of light cheese. Repeat layers. Add a fresh grating of black pepper. Bake at 350F for 25 min. Top with the ½ cup of regular grated cheese and continue to bake until cheese is melted. You can place it under the broiler for the last few minutes to help the cheddar to melt. Garnish with more fresh green onion if using and serve."
