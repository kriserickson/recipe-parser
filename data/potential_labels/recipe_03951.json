    "Pull the membrane from back side of ribs and discard. Combine the next eight ingredients (paprika through black pepper) and rub over ribs until thoroughly coated. Set the ribs aside (or refrigerate the ribs overnight, if you like).",
    "2",
    "Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté until soft, about 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic. Sauté for 1 minute more, then stir in the remaining sauce ingredients. Simmer with vented lid for about 15 minutes (when finished, you can puree the sauce in a blender if you like it smooth). Divide the finished sauce, reserving 1 cup to be passed at the table.",
    "3",
    "When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Cut four pieces of aluminum foil, each a few inches longer than the ribs. Place a rib rack on a piece of foil, top with another piece, and fold the edges to seal completely. Repeat with the other rack. Place the foil packets side by side on a large baking sheet. Bake 2 1/2 hours, until very tender. Remove the pan from the oven, remove the top sheets of foil (and keep them), and use a spoon or basting brush to coat the ribs generously on all sides with the sauce. Bake uncovered about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, and tent with the foil to keep warm. Let rest for 10 minutes before cutting between the ribs. Serve with the extra barbecue sauce."
