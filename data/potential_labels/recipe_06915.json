    "Boil soaked beans in plenty of fresh water for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and drain off all but 2 cups of liquid. While beans boil, heat oven to 220°C. Season oxtails with salt and pepper and spread out in a large roasting dish. Roast about 40 minutes or until oxtails start to brown. Transfer to a large casserole or baking dish, discarding fat.",
    "While oxtails roast, heat oil in a large, heavy pot and cook onions over a moderately low heat, stirring often, until softened. Stir in the beans and the reserved 2 cups of their cooking liquid along with all the remaining ingredients except parsley. Simmer 5 minutes. Transfer to casserole dish with oxtails. Lower oven temperature to 160°C. Cover casserole and bake 2½ hours.",
    "Chill overnight or longer, then remove any fat that sits on top. To reheat, bring back to room temperature then cook 1 hour at 160°C. Serve with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables."
