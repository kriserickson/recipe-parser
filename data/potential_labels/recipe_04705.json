    "In a small pot bring the vinegar to a boil, turn the heat down to medium and let it reduce by half. Remove from the heat and allow to cool 5 minutes, then stir in the honey until dissolved.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the sliced cabbages, onion, and carrot then pour the vinegar mixture over the vegetables and toss well. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, toss again, then allow to sit for 15 minutes, tossing occasionally.",
    "After 15 minutes add the mayonnaise, cayenne, and herbs and toss well to mix everything together. Taste and add more salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Serve immediately. The coleslaw will also keep in the fridge for a couple days, though it will start to get a bit wilty. Toss it again before serving to make sure the dressing is well combined."
