    "Heat your waffle iron according to manufacturer’s directions, at a moderate heat.",
    "In a mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, and seasonings.",
    "Add liquid ingredients, then stir until a stiff batter forms.",
    "Mix in the cheese.",
    "Liberally grease top and bottom panels of the waffle iron, then place a 1/3-cup scoop of batter onto each iron section. Close the iron and cook until steam rises from the machine and the top panel opens freely without sticking to the waffle. Proper cooking usually takes 2 cycles at moderate heat."
