    "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and arrange the salmon in a shallow ovenproof dish. Mix the orange juice with the oil and harissa, then pour over the salmon and bake for 10-12 mins until the fish flakes easily, but is still moist.",
    "Meanwhile, put the couscous in a pan with the orange zest, 200ml water and a sprinkling of salt. Heat until the water bubbles round the edges of the pan, then cover and turn off the heat. After 5 mins, tip the couscous into a bowl, add the cucumber, onion, parsley and almonds (if using) and toss together ready to serve with the salmon and spicy juices."
