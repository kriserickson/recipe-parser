    "1. Throw all ingredients in a high-speed blender.",
    "2. Blend. This recipe can be a bit of a @#$#$% when blending, so if you're having trouble getting the mixture to mix properly, turn your high-speed blender off and insert a spatula down one side to let a pocket of air down near the blades. Then remove the spatula, put the lid back on and continue blending--going from slow all the way up to fast again. You can also add a bit more water (mentioned above) but I try not to add any more water than three additional tablespoons because I like to keep the texture nice and thick.",
    "3. Serve with noodles . For noodles, you all know that I am obsessed with kelp noodles, so that's what I use for my raw macaroni and cheese extravaganzas. But if you're cheap and/or disorganized and don't have raw kelp noodles, you can make zucchini noodles using a carrot peeler or a spiralizer.",
    "4. Garnish with lots of pepper! Normally, I don't really like pepper, but this recipe just totally gets better when you sprinkle a lot of pepper on it. Don't ask me why. It just does. Oh! And you could also even serve with raw ketchup :)",
    "Enjoy this raw macaroni and cheese recipe! I don't have children, but something tells me they would just love this raw recipe as a treat on a cold, wintry day."
