    "First line a loaf tin with grease-proof paper – mine measured around 4 by 10 inches. Then pre-heat oven to 375ºF (190ºC).",
    "Place all the ingredients in a large bowl, and mash with very clean hands until all has blended together well.",
    "Spoon into the loaf tin, and then level it out with the back of a spoon as best you can – you may wish to score it into slices in advance, in readiness if you wish. Then drizzle on some oil of your choice, and cover with foil. Place in the oven for 30 minutes, then raise the temperature to 400ºF (200ºC), and leave in the oven for a further 15 to 20 minutes, until it’s golden brown on top.",
    "Remove from oven, and allow to cool before cutting (this will be easier if you’ve scored it beforehand)."
