    "Heat the oil in a large cast iron Dutch oven or high-sided skillet over medium-high heat and brown the meat, in batches, until browned on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of the chicken broth and stir, scraping the bottom and sides of the pan to loosen any browned particles. Add the onions, bell peppers, salt, cayenne, and black pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the vegetables are wilted. Reduce the heat to medium. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Add the remaining cup of broth and continue to cook, uncovered, for about 1 hour longer, or until the meat is very tender and the gravy is thickened and flavorful. Add the parsley and serve immediately over white rice, if using.",
