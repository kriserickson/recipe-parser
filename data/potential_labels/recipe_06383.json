    "The actual process of making the pizza isn’t too hard as long as you plan ahead and read my instructions. In an effort to keep this post from being too long, I have created a separate page with step-by-step photos to help guide you along so you know exactly what you are doing. Trust me, I know what a pizza crust FAIL tastes like. And I don’t want you to experience that mess!",
    "Knowing how long this will take ahead of time is always helpful. Mixing the dough takes 10 minutes, then there is one main rise for your dough: about 1 – 1.5 hours of you are using instant yeast. If not, see the note in the recipe below. Then you will let your dough rest 2 times for 15 minutes each. So about 2 hours 10 minutes for the crust to do its thing, about 5 minutes to top it, then about 12-15 minutes in the oven for your pizza to be ready. So we’re talking about5 hours start to finish.",
    "A very helpful tip: Be gentle with your dough at ALL times. Let your dough rest as I instruct in the dough recipe. The dough is fragile and should be handled with care."
