    "Add milk, honey, remaining 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, and cornstarch to a small saucepan. Heat over medium, stirring constantly.",
    "As soon as milk mixture boils, remove from heat. Allow to cool one minute and then pour into mug. Stir well to incorporate flavoring. The flavoring will turn the drink a golden, buttery color.",
    "Oh, and if youâ€™re looking for an alcoholic version of this drink, this is the point where we recommend you add a couple tablespoons (to taste) of Dekuyper Butterscotch (a.k.a. Butterscotch Schnapps). The result is fantastic!",
    "Top with whipped cream and drizzle with butterscotch topping, then serve."
