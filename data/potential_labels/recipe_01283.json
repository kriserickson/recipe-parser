    "Meanwhile, blend the mayonnaise, relish, mustard, parsley, salt, pepper and sweetener in a large bowl; set aside. When the cauliflower is ready, drain it well then add it to the mayonnaise mixture. To the same bowl, add the tomatoes, onion and eggs, tossing gently until blended. Cover and chill at least 3 hours.
