    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Wash beets, remove stems, and reserve the leaves.",
    "Coat beets with olive oil and wrap in aluminum foil. Place on baking sheet, and roast for 45-60 minutes. Let cool for 10-15 minutes, then using a vegetable peeler, peel off the first layer of skin. Cut into 8 triangular slices.",
    "Stack each beet leaf on top of each other. Tightly roll the stack of leaves to create a cigar shape, and slice at a perpendicular angle to create thin slices. This cutting technique to thinly slice vegetable greens or herbs is called chiffonade. Fun fact!",
    "On a serving platter, add the arugula, cubed watermelon, and sliced beets. Sprinkle on the chiffonade of beet greens, feta cheese, and pumpkin seeds.",
    "In a small mixing bowl, whisk all of the vinaigrette ingredients. Drizzle dressing on top of the salad, or serve on the side."
