    "Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and fry for 6-8 minutes until tender. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Add a splash of oil to a separate hot frying pan over medium heat and fry the sausages for 6-8 minutes until browned. Add the maple syrup and cook for a further minute or two. Set aside until needed.",

    "Place the bananas, almond milk and salt into a food processor and blend until smooth; pour the mixture into a large mixing bowl. Heat a pan over medium heat until hot and add a splash of oil. Dip each slice of bread in the banana mixture and then fry for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden.",
    "Serve the French toast topped with sausages, mushrooms and avocado. Scatter some pine nuts and basil on top.",
    "TIP: Instead of pine nuts you can also use toasted flaked almonds, cashews, pecan nuts or pistachios.",
    "TIP: Non-stick pans work the best for the French toast. Use medium to high heat, as you need the banana to caramelise, cook and firm up while frying. If the heat is too low it will result in soggy and pale French toast."
