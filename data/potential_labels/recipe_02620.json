    "Mix together the flour, paprika, salt & pepper then work in the margarine (using your hands) until you get a breadcrumb texture. Add the cheese followed by the egg.",
    "Next knead the mixture together to form a dough and leave to rest for 10 minutes.",
    "Now you can either roll out the dough between two pieces of baking paper until about 4mm thick and cut out as desired.",
    "Or you can roll out small pieces between your hands into straw shapes (this is what I prefer to do) and place on a baking tray lined with baking paper.",
    "Preheat the oven to 180c then sprinkle extra cheese on top of your straws.",
    "Bake in the oven for 15 - 18 minutes or until cooked through and the cheese on top is bubbling and golden."
