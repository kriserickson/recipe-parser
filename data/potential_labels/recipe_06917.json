    "Preheat oven to 160°C fanbake and line an oven tray with baking paper.",
    "Mince the nuts, fruits and ginger then stir in the condensed milk and coconut. Shape into small balls or pyramids and roll in extra coconut. Arrange on prepared tray and bake until lightly golden (about 25 minutes). Stored in an airtight container, they will keep for weeks.",
    "TIP",
    "My mother always made her kisses using a meat mincer. You can do it in the food processor but you will end up with a slightly chunkier mix. When the mixture comes out of the mincer it looks decidedly revolting which is why instead of forming it into little logs like my mother did, I like to make little pyramids."
