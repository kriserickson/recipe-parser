    "Preheat oven to 425F. Have two 12-ounce ramekins ready*.",
    "In a large bowl, mix together the hash browns, cheese, onion, olive oil, and salt. Divide evenly between the two ramekins and make a wide enough indent in the middle for adding the egg later.",
    "Bake for 30-40 minutes or until the tops just start to turn golden brown (don't let them get too brown as you still need to cook the egg). Cool for 5 minutes.",
    "Crack each egg into the middle of each bowl. Bake for another 8-12 minutes or until the egg whites are set. Top evenly with bacon and herbs. Serve immediately."
