    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees.",
    "On a cutting board, slice pears in half. To ensure that the pears lay flat while baking, slice off a small piece on the outside of each pear. The middle of the pear should be facing up. With a melon baller or spoon, scoop out the seeds of the pears. Place pears onto a baking sheet or in the bottom of pie dishes. In a medium bowl, whisk together all dry ingredients. With a pastry cutter, cut in butter until crumbles develop.",
    "Top pear halves with crumbles.",
    "Bake for 20 minutes, or until crumbles turn golden brown on top. Serve while warm. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if you’re feeling daring."
