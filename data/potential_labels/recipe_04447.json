    "Half each chicken breast, width-wise, making 6 chicken breasts. Butterfly each breast & lay open.",
    "Stack 3 pieces of black forest ham & lay 1 piece of pepper-jack cheese on top. Roll up the meat & cheese, & place it in the center of a butterflied chicken breast. Fold over the top of the chicken breast to conceal the ham & cheese. Repeat for each chicken breast.",
    "Spray a baking sheet with pan-coating. Season both sides of the prepared chicken breasts with salt & pepper, & place on greased baking sheet.",
    "Bake at 400*F for 20 minutes or until chicken is done & a thermometer reads 165*F in the center.",
    "Meanwhile, in a small saucepan on medium-low heat, whisk together raspberry preserves, pureed chipotle pepper, cider vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper & kosher salt. Bring to a boil & turn heat down to keep warm. Taste & adjust seasonings if necessary. It should have a good kick to it, otherwise you are just putting jam on your chicken. If it is too spicy, add up to ¼ cup more preserves.",
    "Once chicken is cooked drizzle the tops with raspberry sauce & serve."
