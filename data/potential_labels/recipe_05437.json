    "Up to 36 hours ahead - put the split vanilla pod and cream in a\nheavy saucepan and gently bring to\nsimmering point. Whisk as soon as the\nfirst bubbles start to rise, then remove\nthe pan from the heat and leave to\ninfuse for about 20 minutes.",
    "Fish out a half-pod from the cream and\nhold it over the pan, then use the tip of a\nsmall knife to scrape the black seeds\ninside into the pan. Repeat with the other\npod, then whisk to disperse the seeds.",
    "Meanwhile,whizz the egg yolks and\nsugar in a food processor for 2-3 minutes\nuntil thick and creamy. Scrape the mixture\ninto the cream and stir to combine. Place\nthe pan over a medium heat and gently\nwhisk constantly until the custard has\nthickened considerably and is on the\npoint of boiling (when the first few\nbubbles break through the surface).",
    "Immediately remove the pan from the\nheat and plunge the base into a sink of\nice-cold water. Continue to gently whisk for 1-2 minutes, or until most of the heat\nhas dissipated. Leave to cool, whisking\noccasionally to prevent a skin forming.",
    "Meanwhile, place six little heatproof\ndishes, about 10cm in diameter and\n2.5cm deep (see tip), on a tray that will fit\nin the fridge. Divide the blackberries\namong them, then cover with the cool\ncustard and chill until firmly set. Loosely\ndrape with cling film over to cover.",
    "An hour or so before serving - if you don’t have a blow torch to brûlée\nthe custard, use a very hot grill. Sprinkle\na thin, even layer of sugar over each dish\nthen, if using a blow torch, carefully\n‘burn’ the sugar, starting on the nearest\nside: the sugar will bubble and turn a dark\ncaramel. Wait for a few minutes for the\nsurface to harden before serving but DO\nNOT be tempted to touch as the sugar\nremains blisteringly hot for some while.\nAlternatively, put the ramekins on a\nbaking sheet close to the grill until the\nsugar caramelises. Keep them cool until\nready to serve, but not in the fridge or the\ncaramel will soften."
