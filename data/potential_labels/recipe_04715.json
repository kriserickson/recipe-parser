    "So holiday breakfast plans, see if you can’t squeeze enough space for just one more little tray of goodies.",
    "Spiced Cinnamon Sugar Breakfast Puffs (makes one dozen)",
    "1/3 cup unsalted butter",
    "1/2 cup sugar",
    "1 large egg, at room temperature",
    "1 1/2 cup all purpose flour",
    "1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg",
    "1/4 teaspoon allspice",
    "1 pinch ground cloves",
    "1 pinch ground ginger",
    "1 teaspoon orange zest",
    "1/4 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger",
    "1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature",
    "6 tablespoons butter, melted",
    "1/2 cup granulated sugar",
    "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "In a heavy bottomed pan, heat the 1/3 cup butter, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until browned and nutty smelling. Pour into a mixing bowl and allow to cool completely to room temperature.",
    "Preheat your oven to 350F. Grease and lightly flour a 12 cup muffin tin.",
    "Add the sugar and egg to the cooled butter. Beat with an electric mixer until all creamed together.",
    "In a separate little bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, spices, zest, and chopped crystallized ginger. Add the dry ingredients in increments to the butter-sugar mixture, alternating with the milk and beating well after each addition.",
    "Divide the batter evenly into the cups of the muffin tin. Pop into the oven and bake until golden brown and fragrant, about 20-25 minutes.",
    "While the puffs are puffing, put the melted butter in one shallow bowl and combine the sugar and cinnamon in another one. When the puffs come out of the oven, use a knife to gently pop them all out of the muffin tin.",
    "One by one, dip each puff in the melted butter (an ingenious tip from the ladies at Food52: if you don’t have what I call “mom hands” that can handle anything, and the puffs feel too hot to touch, you can spear each in the bottom with a fork and use that to then dunk the puff in the butter) – get it all over it – then roll it in the cinnamon sugar. Transfer it to some lovely, festive serving platter, and continue until you have rolled all of the puffs. Serve warm – they are by faaaaar the best when they are still warm – with coffee, and mimosas, and other goodies."
