    "Directions:",
    "Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Line the baking sheet with parchment paper, or silicone mat.",
    "In a medium jug, beat the eggs, buttercream and milk. Reserve about 2 tablespoon of mixture.",
    "In a mixing bowl with paddle attachment, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the butter and mix until nice and smooth. (Thoroughly coating the flour with butter minimizes the formation of gluten creating tender and light scones.)",
    "Add egg mixture and mix until just combined. Transfer the dough onto well-floured surface.",
    "With floured hand, knead the dough to smooth out the surface and flatten it into 1-inch thick disk. Using 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out as many scones as you can.",
    "Gather the remaining dough and repeat the step #5, until all the dough is used. Arrange the scones on the prepared baking sheet, brush on the reserved egg mixture on each scone and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool the scones on wire rack for 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature with sweet whipped butter.",
    "To make the sweet whipped butter, beat the butter, heavy cream and honey in a mixing bowl with whisk attachment until nice and fluffy.",
    "These scones freeze beautifully. Simply place the baked scones in a ziplock bag and freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to serve, microwave on high for 30-45 seconds.",
    "Slightly adapted from Cook's Illustrated.",
