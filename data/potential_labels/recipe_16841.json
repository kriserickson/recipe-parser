    "Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat until foaming. Add the panko and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.",
    "2",
    "Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel. Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons butter in the same skillet over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon so that it melts evenly. Once the butter begins to foam and form brown bits, add the garlic and red pepper flakes and continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the butter is browned with a nutty aroma. Remove the skillet from the heat.",

    "Add the pasta and Parmesan to the skillet and use tongs to toss together until the pasta is evenly coated with the brown butter and cheese. Add the reserved panko, lemon juice, and parsley and toss to combine."
