    "Melt the butter carefully in microwave oven or double boiler. Do not overheat.",
    "Add sugar to melted butter and mix thoroughly.",
    "Using a power hand mixer blend the eggs into the mixture.",
    "Then add the flour slowly while blending to a smooth consistent batter.",
    "In a small bowl whip the cream fully. Then add and completely blend the whipped cream into the batter.",
    "Add vanilla extract to suit your taste.",
    "If needed add a small amount of milk while blending until the consistency is just spoonable but not quite pourable. The mixture should drop off a measuring spoon but not pour off. This consistency will insure a lacy texture krumkake, but you will find the baked krumkake slightly more difficult to handle without tearing while rolling into a cone. But its worth the effort. Use the latch to obtain a thinner, lacier wafer. For a slightly thicker krumkake do not close the latch while baking."
