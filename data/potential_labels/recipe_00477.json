    "For sauce: In a small bowl, combine oyster sauce, fish sauce, sugar, mirin, rice vinegar, Maggi, sambal and lime juice. Mix well and set aside.",
    "For the noodles: Soak noodles in cold water for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook until tender but still firm, about 8 minutes. Drain most of water from pot, adding just enough cool water so that noodles stay warm but do not continue to cook.",
    "Place a large wok or skillet over high heat. When pan is hot, add oil. Add garlic and sliced scallion bulbs, and saut√© to let flavors infuse oil, about 1 minute. Add chicken and cabbage, and stir-fry until chicken is opaque and beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "Add basil, cilantro and scallion tops. Drain noodles and add to pan. Add sauce, and toss until mixed and well-heated, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot, with lime wedges for squeezing over noodles."
