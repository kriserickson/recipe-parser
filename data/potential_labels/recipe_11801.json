    "After you trim the chicken put the pieces onto a cookie sheet (preferably foil covered, it took me forever to scrub mine clean last time!). Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes until golden and crisp - longer if you like them really crispy.*",
    "Meanwhile in a medium saucepan melt the butter and add the entire bottle of hot sauce as well as the habanero, if using. Simmer over low heat while the wings are in the oven.",
    "Remove wings from the oven and dump into the sauce, toss until well coated. Take them out and put them back on the cookie sheet - back in the oven for another 30 minutes or more.",
    "If you love them really saucy you can repeat this step. Or if you are cooking them for a party later, refrigerate the sauce and wings and then re-dunk and blast for 20 minutes in the oven right (375 F) before your guests arrive.",
    "Serve with lots of celery sticks and good quality blue cheese dressing! Nom, nom, nom!"
