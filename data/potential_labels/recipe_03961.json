    "Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper.",
    "Preheat oven to 425F.",
    "In a dutch oven over-medium high heat, add the olive oil and the chicken thighs, skin-side down. Don't touch the chicken until the skin releases from the surface of the pan, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate, then add the ramps, carrots and potatoes to the dutch oven. Deglaze the pan with wine and stock, then season with salt and pepper, and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add dill, and lemon juice and zest. Return chicken to dutch oven, and simmer until cooked through (about 15-20 mins).",
