    "Follow the instructions that came with your bread machine in terms of which ingredients to put in the bread machine first. I use the basic setting with either medium or light crust. Make sure you check on the dough after five or ten minutes of kneading. Just pop the top of the bread machine and see how the dough is doing. It should be a smooth, round ball. If it’s too dry add liquid a tablespoon at a time until it looks OK. If it looks too wet, add flour a tablespoon at a time until it looks OK.",
    "You’ll notice that I’ve added oil as an optional ingredient. The bread tastes fine without it. However we freeze our bread. We noticed that after freezing the toasted crust is a little tough without the oil.",
    "Hint One – Rapid Rise Yeast: To make this recipe using the quick cycle of your bread machine substitute the regular yeast with three teaspoons of fast rising (rapid rise) yeast.",
    "Hint Two – Sour Milk: Don’t have sour milk, but want that tangy taste? To make sour milk add one tablespoon of vinegar to one cup of room-temperature milk. (adjust amounts as needed for each recipe) Stir and wait about 5 minutes."
