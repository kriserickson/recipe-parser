    "Shred 4 cups of Zucchini and add some salt to remove moisture and set aside for a bit (5-10min or so) . Then remove extra moisture using hands (pretty much squeeze out as much water as you can-I even used paper towels to pay dry). In a mixing bowl add all ingredients and mix together with hands. This recipe will give you two serving/ two pizza crusts. Spread out thin and bake at 375F for about 30 min."
