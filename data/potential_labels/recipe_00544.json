    "A mortar is needed for this. A very very orange yolk is also needed.",
    "Put 3 cloves of garlic and 1/2 tsp of coarse sea salt in a mortar and pound and crush until the garlic is mashed to almost pureed consistency. Add the lemon juice and egg yolk and mix until combined.",
    "Set 1/2 cup of olive oil on the side with a small spoon. Little bit by little bit, 1 small spoon at a time, add the oil into the mortar while turning and mixing it into the egg yolk mixture. DO NOT add the next bit of oil UNTIL all the “current” oil is fully mixed and incorporated. An emulsion will form, and if the oil is added too quickly or by too much, the emulsion will “break”, meaning the oil will separate from the liquid. Do not rush. Feed the dogs and answer all the emails before starting so there’s nothing else to attend to. I ain’t afraid. I’m just being careful.",
    "The color of the mixture will get paler and paler as more oil is added. Do this until all 1/2 cup of oil is incorporated. Add freshly ground black pepper to taste, about 1/4 tsp. Adjust the saltiness with fine sea salt. Refrigerate and it will keep for up to 2 week."
