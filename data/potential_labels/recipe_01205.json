    "Preheat the oven to 350F. Mix together the ground pork, canned crab, wood ear mushrooms and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper and mix. Lightly spray both sides of a wonton wrapper with cooking spray. Place one tablespoon of filling in the wrapper. Take one corner of the wrapper and fold it to the opposite corner. Your wonton should now look like a triangle. Fold the two remaining sides in and press down lightly. Repeat until you have no more filling. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and crunchy."
