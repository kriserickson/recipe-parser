    "HOW TO MAKE IT",
    "Slice the tortilla into strips 1/2-inch wide. Pour 1/2 inch oil in a skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Fry the tortilla strips in batches until crisp and just turning golden, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Remove to a paper towel lined plate.",
    "Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and add the scallions, garlic and chiles. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, just until garlic is fragrant and the scallions and chiles are just softened. Add the ancho chile powder and the flour and stir to combine.",
    "Add the stock and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat and cook about 5 minutes to thicken. Add the Crema and let simmer for 2 minutes. Add the seafood and cook just until the shrimp is pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.",
    "Layer half of the the fried tortilla strips in the bottom of the prepared casserole. Pour half the seafood mixture over it, and repeat with remaining tortilla strips and seafood. Sprinkle with the Queso Fresco. Put in the oven and bake just until the sauce is bubbling, about 15 minutes. Serve at once."
