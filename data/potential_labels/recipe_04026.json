    "In a large, deep-sided skillet or frying pan with a tight-fitting lid, heat butter and olive oil over medium heat. When the butter melts, add onion and sauté for about 5 minutes, or until translucent. Add garlic and jalapeño and sauté for 1 more minute.",
    "Add crushed tomatoes, hot sauce, and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to keep it at a steady simmer. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and coalesced. Stir in mint.",
    "Use a spoon or spatula to make four depressions in the sauce, spacing them evenly throughout the pan. Gently crack an egg into each depression. Season the tops of the eggs with salt and pepper, then cover the pan and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are done to your liking.",
    "Serve the eggs straight from the pan, with plenty of crusty bread for mopping up the yolks and sauce."
