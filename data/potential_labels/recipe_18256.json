    "Bake in a preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, until juices are clear or a meat thermometer reads 160-170 degrees. *Note - depending on the size of your chicken breasts, it could take longer. Mine were pounded to less than an inch thick.",
    "Cover with foil and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes while the juices settle before slicing.",
