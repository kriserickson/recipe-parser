    "Line the baking sheet with foil. (You will want to use a baking sheet that has enough of a rim that it contains the bacon drippings.)",
    "If using a metal cooling rack, spray the rack with non-stick cooking spray, and place the rack inside the baking sheet.",
    "Place the bacon slices in a single layer either directly on the foil or on a rack Make sure not to overlap slices.",
    "Turn the oven on and set to 400 degrees. Do not wait for the oven to preheat. Go ahead and place the pan in the oven.",
    "Cook the bacon for 12-17 minutes. Cooking time depends on the thickness of your bacon, and how long it takes for you oven to come to temperature. Start checking your bacon around 10 minutes to ensure your bacon doesnâ€™t burn. (Nothing worse than burnt bacon!)",
    "When the bacon is golden brown, the bacon is done.",
    "Once the bacon has reached your desired level of crispiness, remove immediately and place on paper towels to soak up the bacon grease.",
    "Eat and enjoy!"
