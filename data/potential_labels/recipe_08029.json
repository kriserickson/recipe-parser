    "1. Pulse 1 cup walnuts in a food processor until finely chopped (about 10 to 15 seconds). Add the dates to the food processor and pulse with the walnuts for another 10 to 15 seconds until the dates are finely chopped and begin to stick to the walnuts.",
    "2. Add 1/4 cup cocoa powder, cacao nibs, honey, coconut oil, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and vanilla extract to the food processor. Pulse the ingredients together for 15 to 20 seconds until the ingredients stick together.",
    "3. Roll the truffle “dough” into tablespoon-size balls. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.",
    "4. Meanwhile, pulse the remaining walnuts, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and sugar (if you desire a sweeter truffle) in the food processor until the walnuts are finely chopped.",
    "5. Remove the truffles from the refrigerator. Individually roll each truffle in the cocoa/walnut powder. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator in an airtight container for two to three weeks.",
    "Chef Suggestions",
