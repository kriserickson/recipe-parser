    "Pour the liquid over the top of the browned meatballs. Reduce the heat to heat to medium low and allow the liquid to come to a simmer. Cover the pan and let the meatballs simmer away for 30-40 minutes or until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice and pasta in the meatballs are cooked through.",
