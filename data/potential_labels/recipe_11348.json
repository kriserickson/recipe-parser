    "Peel the potatoes and cut into equal pieces. Boil in water optionally with salt in 20 min. Cooked. Drain.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the sausages on a high fire round about. Reduce heat to low and cook until cooked in 12 minutes.. Times regularly. Meanwhile, cut the bottom of the sprouts and remove the outer leaves off. Cut them in half and cook in about 8 min. Until al dente. Drain.",
    "Let the potatoes in the pan on the lowest pit on low heat for 2 minutes to boil dry.. The less moisture in the potatoes, the fluffier the mash. Heat the milk in a saucepan over low heat but do not boil. Mash the potatoes with the fine masher. Add the milk and butter and stir lightly with a whisk until the butter is completely melted. Season with nutmeg, pepper and salt. Cut the apple chips into small pieces and stir gently with the sprouts from the stew."
