    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or a Silpat-type liner, and spray lightly with oil.",
    "Add the spinach, shallots, garlic, and parsley to a blender or food processor, and combine until smooth - about as smooth as you can get it.",
    "Add the artichoke hearts, tahini, lemon juice, and spices, and blend to incorporate.",
    "Add the chickpeas and chickpea flour. Pulse until the chickpeas reach a very crumbly (but not smooth) texture.",
    "If the mixture is still too thin to shape into a ball, stir in more chickpea flour as needed. Avoid using the blender to add it so that you don't break up the chickpeas too much more.",
    "Scooping 2-3 tablespoons at a time of the chickpea mixture, form into round shapes and place on the baking sheet, then flatten slightly. Repeat until the whole mixture is used. I filled up both of my small baking sheets.",
    "Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until firm enough to flip over. Bake for another 20-25 minutes on the other side, until browned and slightly crispy on the outside.",
    "For ease of removing from the baking sheet, let cool for a few minutes first."
