    "Make the blue cheese dip first: Mash the blue cheese in a bowl then beat in the soured cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice and seasonings. Cover and chill until needed.",
    "To make the chicken cheese balls: Mix the chicken, cheese and black pepper. Form into golf-ball-sized balls. (The mixture should come together easily, but if it is crumbly, add a little beaten egg.)",
    "Place flour, egg and breadcrumbs into three separate bowls. Dredge the chicken cheese balls in the flour, then in the egg, and finally coat with the breadcrumbs.",
    "Heat oil and deep-fry the balls until golden. (Remember, the meat is already cooked, so this will only take a minute or two.) Drain on paper towels. Serve warm with the Blue Cheese Dip."
