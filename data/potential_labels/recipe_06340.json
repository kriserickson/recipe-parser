    "Divide the dough into small balls, about 25-50 grams depending on how large breads you want.",
    "Roll out circles about (1-2 mm thick). Use plenty of buckwheat flour while rolling so to prevent them from sticking to the rolling pin.",

    "Before you flip the bread, either drizzle a little oil over the uncooked surface or lift the bread and pour a little oil in the pan so that you get oil on both sides.",
    "Wipe out the pan with paper towels between cooking each bread.",
    "Serve the same day or freeze quickly ijust after they have cooled."
