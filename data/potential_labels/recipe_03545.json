    "Wash, peel and core apples. Slice the apples into small cubes. Place the apples in the a large pot, and add 1/2 cup of water. Over medium heat, cook the apples until tender (5 to 20 minutes depending on the type of apple). If you prefer a smooth applesauce, transfer to a food processor or blender and process until smooth. If you prefer it chunky, simply use a potato masher to mash the apples until you reach your desired consistency. If desired, stir in sugar and/or cinnamon. Store in the refrigerator, or can the applesauce using the directions below."
