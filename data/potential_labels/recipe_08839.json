    "The sauce",
    "Some people use a jar of their favorite pasta sauce, but it’s just not the same. To start, heat olive oil on medium heat in a large pan. Add the onions and bell pepper and fry until the onions start to become translucent. Add the garlic and zucchini. Cook for 3 minutes stirring occasionally. Salt and pepper. Add tomato sauce (we like to use plain tomato sauce- just blended tomatoes- no funny stuff). Simmer for 5 minutes stirring often. Add the fresh basil during the simmer. Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper to your preference.",
    "Building the lasagna",
    "Preheat oven to 350F/175C.",
    "First put a small layer of sauce on the bottom of your dish.",
    "Soak 3 matzah sheets for 30 seconds in warm water. Shake off excess water. Place one sheet of matzah on top of the sauce. If you’re using a wide dish, you might need more matzah to fill the shape.",
    "Then spread 1/3 of the ricotta on the matzah.",
    "Then 1/3 of the mozzarella.",
    "Then 1/3 of the Parmesan.",
    "Then sauce again and repeat layers.",
    "Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes.",
    "Remove foil and bake for 25 more minutes. If the top is still not browning around the edges put it under the broiler for a couple mins. Keep and eye on it though or it will burn!"
