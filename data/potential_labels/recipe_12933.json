    "Trim the meat / remove any silverskin",
    "Rinse the meat and dry it with paper towels.",
    "Inject the brisket with 1 ounce of beef broth per pound of raw meat (the extra moisture will keep it from dehydrating). Do it in the sink and be careful so you don't get squirted in the eye.",
    "Salt the meat with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt per pound of meat.",
    "Insert the digital thermometer probe with the tip centered in the thickest part of the meat.",
    "Refrigerate for 12 hours.",
    "Preheat smoker to about 235°F. We want to cook at about 225°F, but the temp will drop a bit once you load in the cold meat.",
    "Smoke the meat until the stall, which occurs around 150°F.",
    "Take it off and wrap it tightly in a double layer of heavy-duty foil or pink butchers paper. The more airspace around the meat the more juice leaks out of the meat. Crimp it tight and put the wrapped meat back on the smoker at 225°F",
    "When the temp hits 200 to 205°F remove the still-wrapped brisket from the smoker and place in a large pan. Leave the thermometer probe in.",
    "Place the pan in a plastic beer cooler lined with a towel, blanket, or crumpled newspaper.",
    "Close the cooler lid and let themeat sit in the cooler for at least 2 to 3 hours until you are ready to eat. If you can, wait til it drops to 140°F to slice."
