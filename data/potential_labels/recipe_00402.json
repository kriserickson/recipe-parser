    "Step 1 Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until they begin to pop. Add tomatoes, onions, chillies, vinegar, sugar and spice, and stir to combine. Increase heat and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 2 1/4 hours or until excess liquid evaporates and mixture thickens. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Step 2 Thoroughly wash glass jar and lid in hot soapy water and rinse well. Drain upside down until ready to use. Spoon hot chutney into clean jar and seal immediately. Turn upside down for 2 minutes. Turn upright and set aside until cooled. Label, date and store in a cool, dark place until ready to use."
