    "DIRECTIONS",
    "In a bowl, stir together the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla extract, lemon juice and lemon zest until well combined. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag and refrigerate.",
    "Combine the chocolate chips and vegetable oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval, until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth. (Alternately, you can melt the chocolate with the oil in a double boiler.)",
    "Line the mini muffin pan with the paper candy cups. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the melted chocolate into each cup, tap the pan on the counter so the chocolate flattens out then refrigerate the pan for 15 minutes until the chocolate is firm.",
    "Remove the pan and the cheesecake mixture from the fridge. Pipe a portion of the cheesecake mixture in the center of each cup, then top the cheesecake with another 1 to 2 teaspoons of melted chocolate. Sprinkle the tops of each cup with sea salt then return the pan to the fridge for 20 minutes until the chocolate has fully hardened. If not serving immediately, store the cups in an airtight container in the fridge."
