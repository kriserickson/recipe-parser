    "In a large heavy cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until browned and crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain, reserving the fat in the skillet.",
    "Add the English muffins to the fat in the skillet and brown, turning once, until golden, about 4 minutes.",
    "Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, cream, eggs and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Stir half the cheese and half the reserved bacon into the egg mixture, then stir in the English muffin cubes. Let the English muffins soak in the egg mixture for 5 minutes, then transfer to a buttered 8-inch square baking dish. Sprinkle the bread pudding with the remaining cheese and reserved bacon and bake until set, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool slightly, then serve."
