    "How to Make It:",
    "1. Preheat oven to 375F.",

    "3. Grease a large pan with olive oil (a pizza pan or cookie sheet will work!) Spread dough evenly. Brush crust with olive oil.",
    "4. Bake crust for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, sauté sausage and mushrooms.",
    "5. Remove crust from oven. Spread sauce over crust. Top with sausage, mushrooms and artichoke hearts. Bake an additional 10 minutes.",
