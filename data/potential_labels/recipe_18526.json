    "Preheat oven to 400ºF and lightly oil a 12\" x 18\" sheet pan.",
    "In a large bowl mix all of the ingredients for the veggies and chickpeas and toss to combine. Place the vegetable mixture on the sheet pan, spread out evenly and bake for 15 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile to the bowl add the egg, almond flour, oregano, salt, pepper, lemon zest and garlic and whisk until combined. Add in the spinach, feta, green onions and ground chicken and mix together.",
    "Take the sheet pan out of the oven at 15 minutes and move the veggies and chickpeas to each side to make space in the center for the meatballs.",
    "Using a small scoop (like a cookie scoop) portion meatballs onto the sheet pan (you want the meatballs to me on the small size, about 1” in diameter). Bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the meatballs have cooked through to 165ºF.",
    "Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately, or portion in meal prep containers and cool completely before closing the lid."
