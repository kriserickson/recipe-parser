    "Finely grate cucumber with the skin on - should yield about 1 cup. Then either set in a fine-mesh strainer set over a small mixing bowl or transfer to a clean, thin towel and squeeze out excess moisture. The remaining amount should be about 1/4 cup.",
    "Add coconut yogurt to a large mixing bowl and add strained cucumber, garlic, dill, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and olive oil (optional). Stir to combine.",
    "Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for overall flavor, garlic for zing, lemon for acidity, or dill for herbiness.",
    "Serve immediately, or store in the refrigerator (where it will thicken) up to 5 days, sometimes longer depending on freshness of yogurt.",
    "This Tzatziki is delicious on its own, but it also pairs well with Greek-inspired recipes like these Traditional Vegan Falafel, Tabbouleh Salads, Shawarma Sandwiches, or Buddha Bowls."
