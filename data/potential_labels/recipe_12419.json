    "Partially bake pie crust in a 400-degree oven for about 7 minutes, covered in foil plus an additional 10 minutes uncovered. While crust is baking, in a large bowl, beat eggs. Add milk, half-and-half, parsley, green onions and salmon. In a small bowl, combine cheese, flour, salt and pepper. Stir into egg mixture and pour into baked pie crust. Reduce oven to 325 degrees and bake quiche 45 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve immediately.",
