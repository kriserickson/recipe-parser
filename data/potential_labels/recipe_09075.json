    "In a large stockpot or dutch oven, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, potatoes, and cauliflower/red pepper, and cook about 5 minutes, stirring a few times during that time. Add the broth, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover the soup, and cook another 20 minutes. Stir in the pasta and cook 5 more minutes. Stir in the peas and corn and cook about five more minutes, until the peas and corn are heated throughly. Enjoy!",
    "Notes: To make this a vegan soup, use oil instead of butter and vegetable stock instead of chicken stock."
