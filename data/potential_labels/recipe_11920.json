    "1. Remove corn husks from cob. Slice the kernels off the cob by holding the corn cob vertically and carefully slicing down toward your cutting board.",
    "2. Add all ingredients (except the second amount of corn) into your blender. Blend on high until very smooth and well-blended. Blend for longer than you would blend a smoothie, because you want the soup to be warm when coming out of the blender.",
    "3. Pour chowder into a bowl. Add remaining corn and stir with a spoon. Garnish with pepper and chopped cilantro (optional).",
    "4. Enjoy chowder immediately, while still warm from the blender."
