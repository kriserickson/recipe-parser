    "In a large soup pot heat the oil and fry the bacon pieces on medium heat until crispy. Lift out of the pot and set aside.",
    "Cut off the root end and dark green tops of the leek. We only want the white and light green part. Slice open lengthwise and clean thoroughly (leeks tend to trap dirt in the layers). Then cut finely.",
    "Add the leek, garlic and frozen corn to the pot and cook on medium for a few minutes until the leek has softened (and corn should be thawed). Now add the potato and carrot dices and pour broth over. All the vegetables should be covered.",
    "Bring to a boil, then turn to low and simmer until potatoes and carrots are soft (about 20 minutes).",
    "Puree about ⅓ of the soup in a blender. Add pureed soup back into the pot. Season to taste with nutmeg, oregano, black pepper (about ½ teaspoon each) and cayenne pepper (1/4 teaspoon), if you would like some heat.",
    "Served topped with the bacon pieces, green onion slices or even some raw leek rings."
