    "Step 1 To make the roti, mix the flour, oil and spinach with a pinch salt and 75ml water. Knead on a floured work surface until you get a smooth dough. Leave to rest for 10 minutes.",
    "Step 2 Make the masala by mixing the spices. Blend the onion, garlic, ginger and most of the coriander to a paste in a small blender. Fry the paste in 1 tsp oil until fragrant, then add the spice mix. Fry for another minute before adding the tomatoes and bringing to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes until thickened.",
    "Step 3 Divide the dough into 2, and roll into thin breads. Dry fry in a frying pan for 3 minutes on each side until cooked and starting to puff up. Keep warm while you make the curry.",
    "Step 4 Stir the prawns into the curry and cook until pink, then season with lemon juice and scatter over the remaining coriander.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads"
