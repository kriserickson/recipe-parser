    "Season the chicken liberally with the salt, Cajun seasoning, and olive oil. Then, grill on a grill pan until cooked through.",
    "Meanwhile, for the pasta sauce, melt the butter and olive oil together and then saut√© the onion and garlic until the onions are translucent. Then, add in the salt, dried oregano, and dried basil and cook for 60 seconds more.",
    "Add the rum and chicken stock and cook until the liquid has just about reduced. Then, add the heavy cream and peas and cook until the cream has thickened. This should take about 5 minutes on highly heat.",
    "Finally, add in the Parmesan cheese and taste the sauce. Add more salt and pepper, if necessary. To serve, toss with the cooked pasta and serve by adding slices of the grilled chicken."
