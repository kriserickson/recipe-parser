    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.",
    "While the pasta cooks, melt the butter in a skillet or pot large enough to hold the pasta when it's done.",
    "Add the milk and whisk to remove any lumps and add the salt and pepper, cayenne, and mustard.",

    "Stir the pasta into the sauce and bake in a greased 2 quart dish (or an 8x8 pan works pretty well) 20-25 minutes until browned and bubbly. You can also skip baking it if you want it super creamy and just put it under the broiler to brown the top (keep an eye on it) and then serve."
