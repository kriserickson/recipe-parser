    "Preheat the oven to 160°C, 140°C fan, Gas Mark 3.",
    "Heat the oil in an ovenproof casserole or metal pot. Fry the beef so that all the sides turn brown.",
    "Remove from the pan and set to one side. Add the onion, garlic and bacon to the pan and cook for 1 minute., Stir in the flour and mix. Add the wine, water, Knorr Stock Pot, and tomato puree.",
    "Mix and bring to the boil. Return the beef to the mix and throw in the mushrooms, rosemary and Worcestershire Sauce.",
    "Transfer the cooking pot with the lid on to the oven for 2 hours or until the beef is tender.",
    "Slow Cooker Note: If you want to use a slow cooker then just do all the steps in a large pan and transfer to the slow cooker when the casserole is ready to go into the oven. Cook in the slow cooker on high for 1 hour, then 5–6 hours on low (or just 6–7 hours on auto)."
