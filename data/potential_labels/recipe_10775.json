    "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and lightly spray with nonstick spray.",
    "Separate the eggs, making sure no yolk gets into the whites and placing the whites in a clean, non-greasy bowl.",
    "Using a clean, non-greasy electric whisk, whip the egg whites and the cream of tartar until stiff.",
    "In a separate bowl, use the same whisk to whisk together the yolks, cream cheese and salt, until smooth.",
    "Using a spatula, carefully fold the egg whites into the cream cheese mixture, working in batches. Work by placing a mound of egg whites on top of the yolk mixture, then gently fold the yolk mixture from under and over the egg whites, rotating the bowl, again and again until the mixture is incorporated. You want to use the folding technique because you want to keep the air bubbles intact in the egg whites.",
    "Spoon 6 large mounds of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Gently press with a spatula on the top of each mound to flatten just slightly.",
    "Bake 30-40 minutes, until golden-brown.",
    "Cool a couple of minutes on the cookie sheet, then gently transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store leftovers in a slightly open Ziploc bag in the fridge for a couple of days."
