    "Instructions",
    "Combine the chicken and all the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Mix well. Let marinate for 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "Mix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.",
    "Add 1 tablespoon oil into the Instant Pot. Swirl to coat the bottom. Turn on the Saute function of the Instant Pot and wait until it shows as hot.",
    "Spread half of the chicken in a single layer. Let cook without touching, until the bottom turns golden, 1 to 2 minutes. (*Footnote 2) Turn to cook the other side for 1 minute. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Cook the rest of the chicken in the same way.",
    "Add the chicken back into the pot. Add the garlic and ginger. Stir and cook for 30 seconds.",
    "Pour in the sauce and use a wooden spatula to scrape the bottom, to release any stuck bits.",
    "Close and seal the lid. Use Manual mode on high pressure for 5 minutes. Use fast pressure release when done.",
    "Turn on Saute mode. (*Footnote 3)",
    "Mix the cornstarch with the rice vinegar and whisk until the cornstarch dissolves completely. Pour into the Instant Pot. Add the orange zest, if using. Stir and cook until the sauce has thickened. Turn off the Instant Pot and immediately transfer everything to a serving plate.",
    "Serve hot over steamed rice.",
    "Recipe Notes",
    "To make the dish gluten free, use tamari or coconut aminos to replace the soy sauce, and use dry sherry instead of Shaoxing wine.",
    "Orange zest will add a refreshing, strong citrus taste to the dish. If you are in a hurry, you can skip this ingredient and still get a very tasty result.",
    "When browning the chicken in your Instant Pot, not moving the chicken will make it much easier to release the chicken and prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.",
    "If you want to add some veggies to your meal, dice some bell peppers and throw them in before adding the cornstarch. Cook them for 1 minute before adding the cornstarch slurry."
