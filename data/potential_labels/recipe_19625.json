    "Combine the almond flour, psyllium husk powder, gelatin powder, and sea salt in a food processor. Process until uniform.",
    "Add the eggs and water. Process until the dough pulls away from the sides and forms a ball. If it's too dry, add more water a tablespoon at a time until the dough forms. It should be dense, moist, and dough-y, not wet or dry. Scrape any ingredients stuck to the sides with a spatula if needed.",
    "Cut the dough ball into 6 sections. (The easiest way is to flatten into a disc and cut like a pie.)",
    "Roll each section into a ball, about the size of a golf ball, then roll into a 1/8-inch-thick (.3 cm) circle between two pieces of parchment paper. (You can also flatten using a tortilla press if you have one.)",
    "Heat a very lightly oiled pan over medium heat. (Do not add too much oil or the tortillas will get crisp.) Add a tortilla and cook for 30-60 seconds per side, until golden. Flip and repeat on the other side. Repeat with remaining tortillas."
