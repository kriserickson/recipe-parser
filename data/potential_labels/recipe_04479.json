    "Place cheese cubes in a heavy-bottomed sauce pan set over low heat. Pour in milk or half & half to cover. Heat ingredients, stirring constantly. The cheese may appear stringy, but it will become more liquid over time.",
    "Take the pan off the burner for 3 minutes. Add the beaten egg yolks and butter, then stir with a large wooden spoon using a figure eight motion until smooth.",
    "Rub the fondue pot with garlic cloves. Discard the cloves, then transfer the cheese mixture to the fondue pot. If desired, grate black truffle over the fondue.",
    "Serve immediately with the prepared vegetables, meats, or apple slices for dipping."
