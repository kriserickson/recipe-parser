    "Preheat your oven to 425 F. In two baking trays arrange the sliced eggplants. Sprinkle the Himalayan salt and bake for 15-20 minutes.",
    "Remove the bake eggplant from the oven and turn your broiler on. Spread 1 tablespoon of tomato sauce over each eggplant round followed by one slice of provolone. Arrange some fresh spinach and cherry tomatoes over the cheese and broil for 3-5 minutes. Make sure you keep a close look while the eggplant is under the broiler as they can burn really fast.",
    "Serve while still hot. I had my eggplant pizza slices in between whole grain crusty bread and it was the bomb."
