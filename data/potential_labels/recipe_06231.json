    "Place garlic in a microwaveable cup; add butter and heat about 20 seconds until butter is hot and mixed with garlic. Slice a groove or \"pocket\" most of the way through fish steak, from one side to the other, and stuff with feta cheese. Place in baking dish. Drizzle the garlic-butter mixture over the top and onto the cheese. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. Ahi should be rare inside for best flavor, but salmon should flake easily.",
    "HELPFUL TIPS:",
    "Ahi is best served slightly red in the center, unlike some other fish. Salmon should be flaky. Serve with rice and vegetables."
