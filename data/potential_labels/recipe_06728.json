    "Separate the egg white from yolk.",
    "Preheat oven at 170°C.",
    "Break the chocolate into small pieces and put into a bowl over hot water. Melt until smooth.",
    "Beat egg whites with an electric beater until soft peaks form. Beat till firm. (a slightest amount of yolk in the whites will prevent the whites from firming, so be careful)",
    "When chocolate is smooth, incorporate in the cream cheese by hand and mix well.",
    "Remove from heat and then add 1/3 of the meringue and mix well. To mix the batter with the meringue, use a whisky and slowly mix the two components in order not to lose the air bubbles in the meringue.",
    "Add in the rest of the meringue, half of the remaining meringue at a time.",
    "Add a layer of oil on parchment paper that will be used to line all sides of a 15cm mold or pan. it will prevent the cake from sticking to the mold.",
    "Pour in batter.",
    "Place mold in a larger mold that is filled with hot water.",
    "Bake in oven in 3 steps: first 15mins at 170°C, another 15mins at 160°C and then turn off oven and bake for remaining 15mins for another 15mins.",
    "Remove from oven and leave to cool off completely on wire rack.",
    "Remove from mold and dust with a bit of icing sugar if you want."
