    "In large, heavy-based saucepan, melt the butter over a low heat, then gently sweat all the vegetables until soft - about 20 minutes. Add the stock, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 20 to 30 minutes, until the artichokes can be easily mashed against the side of the pan with the back of a wooden spoon. Leave to cool slightly.",
    "Liquidise the soup until smooth (you may need to do this in batches), then return to the pot. Warm over a medium heat, add the cream and season generously. Serve in warmed bowls, topped with a spoonful of chestnut and parsley pesto (see following recipe), and finish with a swirl of rapeseed oil."
