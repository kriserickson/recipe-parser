    "Put a large sauté pan over a medium heat and crumble in the beef or turkey. Fry until the meat starts to brown then add the bell pepper and onion. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the veggies start to soften – this should take around 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "When the veggies are tender, add the tomato purée and stir into the meat, then add the vinegar, brown sugar, honey, mustard and chile powder to the pan and give everything a really good stir. Add the beans, season with salt and pepper, then bring to a boil and cook until the sauce is nice and thick.",
    "To serve: pile the Sloppy Joe mix onto the bottom of a bun or middle of a wrap, top it with lettuce and close up the sandwich or roll up the wrap."
