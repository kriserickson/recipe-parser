    "Instructions",
    "For these bars, I used a 5\" x 5\" square dish. It made 4 very thick bars. You could double the recipe and fill a large dish - or try to use whatever dish you have on hand. The dish size will change the thickness of the bars.",
    "Prepare the dish by layering it with parchment paper.",
    "In a blender, process the cookies until they become a fine powder. Transfer the powder to a small bowl and combine with the crust oil. Then pour the oiled crumbs into the parchment-lined dish and flatted down a bit. This doesn't have to be donw perfectly, the cashew mixture does an excellent job of soaking up the crumbs and helping with binding of the crust.",
    "In a blender, process all the fink filling mixture until silky smooth. Process on high for a few minutes to slightly warm the mixture - I find that this changes and thickens the mixture a bit, which I like. It lightly cooks it from the heat of the blender. (High speed blenders or food processors work best for processing this recipe. I used my Vitamix.)",
    "Pour the filling into the dish, over the crust and smooth with a spatula. Add the citrus zest on top.",
    "Chill in the fridge overnight or for at least a few hours. Slice and serve. The bites will soften up pretty quickly, so if serving for a party, you will want them to be served within a half hour or so or presenting them. Otherwise, serve them on some ice to keep them nice a firm. I like these slightly soft - which is the texture they get after about 15 minutes at room temperature.",
    "Yield: 4 large bars",
    "Prep Time: 00 hrs. 10 mins.",
    "Total time: 10 mins."

    "Ingredients",
    "2 cups soaked raw cashews, drained***",
    "1/2 cup virgin coconut oil, melted",
    "1/2 tsp vanilla extract (or a real vanilla bean)",
    "1/4 cup fresh grapefruit juice (or sub with lemon or orange)",
    "1/3 cup maple syrup",
    "1/8 tsp salt",
    "1-2 Tbsp frozen pitaya puree (or use fresh dragonfruit if in season)",
    "on top: 1 tsp grapefruit zest",
    "Crust:",
    "4-5 vegan, gluten-free gingersnap cookies",
    "1 Tbsp virgin coconut oil, melted",
    "***If you do not have time to soak the cashews, you may be ok using unsoaked -- just give them a \"quick soak\" for 2-3 minutes in some boiling salted water to help soften a bit. And run your Vitamix on high for a few minutes longer. You may also want to add a splash of water to the mixture. (I have not tested it this way, but think it will work.)"
