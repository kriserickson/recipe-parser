    "Heat a small, heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the cumin and coriander seeds and cook until they turn a dark color and are fragrant, about 2 minutes, shaking the pan constantly and taking care not to burn the spices. Transfer to a mortar and grind until coarsely powdered.",
    "Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and onions and sauté until the onions have softened and begun to caramelize, stirring from time to time, about 8-10 minutes.",
    "Add the roasted seeds, chili powder, chipotle, garlic, and green chiles and sauté for 1-2 minutes. Add the puréed tomatoes and tomato juice, mix well and bring to a boil.",
    "Reduce heat to a simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Add the beans and return to a boil. Reduce heat again, cover and simmer for 20 minutes until the chili has thickened, stirring from time to time to prevent it from sticking to the pan. (If chili gets too thick, thin with a little reserved cooking water from the beans.)",
    "When the chili is ready, remove from heat. Add the salt, tequila, and cilantro and stir well. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary.",
    "Spoon the quinoa into large bowls, top with the chili, and garnish with a little sour cream and scallions. Serve immediately."
