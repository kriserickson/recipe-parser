    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "Place the squash, onion or leek, apple, carrot, and water or stock in a slow cooker. If using water, add 1 tablespoon kosher salt. If using stock, add a pinch of salt, then adjust at the end. Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 8 hours, until the squash and carrots are cooked through.",
    "Stir in the coconut milk. Puree the soup in the slow cooker with an immersion blender until smooth (or in a stand blender in batches.) Taste and adjust seasoning accordingly. I consistently add 3/4 cup coconut milk (total) and another teaspoon of kosher salt, but make your adjustments to taste.",
    "For the garnish, which is optional: Heat a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add the oil and leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.",
    "To serve, pour the soup into 6 serving bowls and garnish with the crispy leeks. Drizzle with more coconut milk if desired. I like lots of cracked black pepper over top."
