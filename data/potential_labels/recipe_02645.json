    "Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut four 12-by-17-inch pieces of parchment. Fold each in half crosswise to make a crease, then unfold and lay flat.",
    "Toss mushrooms, asparagus, and scallions with oil in a bowl. Sprinkle with lemon zest, and season with salt and pepper. Remove asparagus from mixture; divide evenly among parchment pieces, creating a bed of spears on one side of crease. Top each with 1 piece of fish, then with mushroom mixture. Drizzle each serving with 1 tablespoon water. Fold parchment over ingredients, creating a half-moon shape. Make small overlapping pleats to seal the open sides.",
    "Bake on 2 rimmed baking sheets until packets are puffed, 9 minutes (fish should be partially opaque in the middle). Open packets, squeeze with lemon, and serve immediately."
