    "In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heal oil over medium high. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Working in two batches, cook chicken until browned on all sides, about 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat and return pot to heat.",
    "Add garlic, tomatoes, and oregano; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add wine and cook, scraping up brown bits, until almost evaporated, about 1 minute. Add broth; return chicken, skin side up, to pot. Bring to a boil; reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook 15 minutes. Add zucchini; season with salt and pepper. Cover; simmer until chicken is cooked through. 10-15 minutes. Stir in lemon juice.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large saucepan combine 4 1/2 cups water, 1 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper and bring to a boil. Whisking constantly, slowly add cornmeal. Reduce heat to medium low and cook. Whisk frequently until polenta has thickened, 20-25 minutes. Whisk in butter. Serve chicken and vegetables over polenta."
