    "Put carrots in a sauté pan, season aggressively with salt and add a tablespoon of the vinegar. Add cold water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the carrots. Set pan over high heat and bring liquid to a boil.",
    "Turn heat down to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until carrots are just cooked through, about 15 minutes. (If pan appears about to dry out during this process, add a splash or two of water.)",
    "Once carrots are cooked through, discard any excess liquid in the pan. Add remaining tablespoon sherry vinegar to pan, along with the honey, olive oil, shallot and thyme, and cook for about 2 minutes to glaze the carrots. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, or at room temperature, or cold from the refrigerator."
