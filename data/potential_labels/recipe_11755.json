    "Place 1/4 cup pistachios in the food processor and ground until resembles coarse sand. Remove from bowl and set aside. Then add cashews and remaining 1/4 cup pistachios into the food processor and process until well ground. Add dates and remaining ingredients. Process until well combined and smooth. Taste for flavor and adjust as needed. Roll into balls (warning, dough will be sticky) and place each ball into the bowl of pistachios, coating fully. Store in freezer or fridge. Makes 9 good size balls."
