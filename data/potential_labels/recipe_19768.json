    "Soak the onion in cold water to mellow it, about 20 minutes. Drain.",
    "In an 8-inch skillet, heat the oil, cumin, and coriander over medium-low heat until the spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Let cool completely.",
    "Add the lemon juice and zest, honey, and 1/2 tsp. salt to the spices in the pan and stir to combine. With a silicone spatula, fold in the yogurt until well combined.",
    "Put the cabbage, carrots, mint, and onion in a large serving bowl. Toss the salad with about two-thirds of the dressing. Let sit for about 10 minutes to soften the cabbage. Sprinkle the chopped pistachios over the salad. Grind some black pepper over the top and then drizzle with more dressing to taste. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper, and serve."
