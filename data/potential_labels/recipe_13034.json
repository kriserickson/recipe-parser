    "Directions",
    "Preheat oven to 350 Degrees F.",
    "In a medium size bowl, add feta and dill, set aside.Â In a medium size sauce pan, heat olive oil on medium-high heat, add garlic and green onions - saute for 3-5 minutes. Add defrosted/drained spinach to pan and mix the garlic, onions and spinach together. Once blended well, pour on top of the feta and dill. Next add the lemon juice and mix everything together. Place triangle crescent rolls on clean surface and add one heaping scoop (I use a medium size Pampered Chef Scooper) of spinach mixture to each crescent roll, fold and pinch openings closed. See photos below. Place rolls on an ungreased cookie sheet, place on middle rack of oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, until rolls are golden brown. Remove and serve warm. Enjoy!",
    "*Be sure to drain as much of the liquid out of the spinach before adding. You can use a colander, pressing the spinach with your hands or spoon."
