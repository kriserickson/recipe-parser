    "Pour into ramekins. I used 3 small 3″ x 1 1/2″ ramekins, but feel free to use a different size.",
    "Refrigerate until ready to serve.",
    "Once ready, sprinkle sugar in a thin coat on top and spread with a spoon to create a flat surface.",
    "Evenly torch the surface. Don’t be afraid to get close! The hotter the flame the better it will bubble, just don’t leave it in one spot too long or it may turn black. You are looking for a dark brown color. I found the best way to achieve this is to torch the surface 3 times with 30 second breaks in between.",
    "Let the surface set for 5 minutes before eating."
