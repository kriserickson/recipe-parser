    "1. Throw all ingredients in a high-speed blender and blend up 'til nice and smooth and well mixed. You can let the soup blend in the blender for a little extra time so that the heat of the blades and the friction actually warm up this delicious, creamy raw soup. Blend until very creamy and smooth.",
    "2. Transfer raw creamy carrot soup to a bowl.",
    "3. Garnish with whatever you like! I simply sprinkled my soup with pepper and a tiny carrot garnish. Eat immediately."
