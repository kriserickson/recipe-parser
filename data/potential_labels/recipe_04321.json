    "In a medium skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil. Add the carrots, celery, onion and bell pepper and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the soffrito is tender and lightly browned, about 8 minutes.",
    "In a large skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil until shimmering. Add the snap peas and cook over high heat just until they are bright green, about 2 minutes. Add the soffrito and cook until the snap peas are lightly browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Add the crushed red pepper and 1/4 cup of water and cook until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes longer. Add the torn mint and season with salt. Serve hot or at room temperature."
