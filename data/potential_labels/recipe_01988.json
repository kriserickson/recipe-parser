    "Chocolate Melt chocolate at 50% power in the microwave stirring every 30 seconds. The chocolate does not have to be completely melted, as it sits little pieces will melt in. Be extra careful not to overheat the chocolate or it will seize. Place about a teaspoon of chocolate in each well or muffin cup and with the back of a spoon, \"pull\" the chocolate up the sides ensuring the bottom and sides are completely covered.",
    "Place in the freezer for about 30 seconds to stiffen up the chocolate and you can \"re-pull\" more or fill in any gaps. (I held my mold up to light and it was easy to see spots where the chocolate was thin) Place back into the fridge until cold Filling Mix together peanut butter, powdered sugar, salt and graham crumbs in a bowl Microwave about 90 seconds to soften the mixture and allow it to be poured. Place 1 tablespoon of the peanut butter mixture into the wells and gently tap or shake to smooth it.",
