    "First you need to preheat oven to 350 degree F. Spray a 12 cup bundt pan generously with baking spray. Set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, combined all the ingredients for the cake, mixing until well combined. Batter will be very thick! Set aside.",
    "For the filling, beat cream cheese with sugar, vanilla and egg until smooth and creamy. Set aside.",
    "To assemble, fill bottom of sprayed bundt pan with about 3/4 of the batter. Spoon the cream cheese into the pan, being careful not to let it touch the sides of the pan. Spoon the remaining batter over the cream cheese layer. It's okay if it doesn't cover completely.",
    "Bake cake in a preheated oven for 60-65 minutes. Cake will be browned and will pull away from the pan when done. Remove from oven and cool for 5-10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack. Cool completely before frosting.",
    "For the frosting, beat cream cheese, milk and powdered sugar together until smooth and creamy. Pour frosting into a large ziploc bag and snip off the corner. Pipe onto cake, generously. Sprinkle immediately with chopped pecans."
