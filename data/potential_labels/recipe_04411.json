    "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the broccolini, 2 tablespoons water, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.",
    "Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet. Add the eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste and cook, stirring with a rubber spatula, until the eggs are just barely set, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the broccolini and ricotta. Sprinkle with the parmesan. Serve with bread, if desired.",
