    "Meanwhile, cook steak. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season steak with coriander and season with salt and pepper. Cook, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 130ยบ F for medium rare, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes, then slice. Serve with potatoes and garnish with chives."
