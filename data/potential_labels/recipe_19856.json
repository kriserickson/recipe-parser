    "Special equipment: a 4-, 6- or 8-quart Instant Pot® multi-cooker",
    "Combine 1 pound penne, 4 cups water and 2 teaspoons kosher salt in an Instant Pot® multi-cooker. Follow the manufacturer's guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 5 minutes.",
    "After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer's guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid. There is no need to drain the pasta, but you can stir in 1 tablespoon butter or olive oil to keep it from sticking."
