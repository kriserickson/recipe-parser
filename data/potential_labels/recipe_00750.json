    "In a medium saucepan, add the peaches, water & sugar. Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 3 minutes.",
    "Very carefully pour mixture into a blender or food processor and let stand for approximately 20 minutes.",
    "If using a blender, take the center out of the lid and place lid tightly on blender, covering the top with a kitchen towel. (I used my Ninja and it has a little lid at the top you can open as well). Blend or process until smooth. Pour into a large container and refrigerate peach puree for approximately 3 hours (or overnight if preparing a day ahead).",
    "After peach puree has chilled, press the mixture through a sieve into a large container, reserving the liquid and discarding the solids. Pour peach juice into a pitcher and add lemon juice. Stir until combined. Taste and add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water to dilute if too concentrated.",
    "Serve by pouring approximately 2/3 cup of peach lemonade in a small glass over approximately 1/2 cup of ice. Garnish with a peach wedge if desired."
