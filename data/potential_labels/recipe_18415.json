    "Combine the lemon juice, garlic, and a generous pinch of salt in a small bowl and set aside.",
    "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat.",
    "Meanwhile, put the chicken broth in a medium (3-quart) saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil until the broth has reduced to 1 cup, 20 to 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. Add the lemon-garlic mixture and whisk in the butter one piece at a time. Keep warm.",
    "Cook the orzo in the boiling water until barely al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain and immediately toss with the broth mixture. Add the 1/2 cup Parmigiano and the parsley and thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss well to combine. Serve immediately, sprinkled with additional Parmigiano."
