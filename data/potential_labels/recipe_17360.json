    "Although not as well known to Scandinavian-Americans as potato lefse, Hardanger lefse has a much longer history than potato lefse, dating as it does to Viking days (potatoes weren't introduced to Norway until the 18th century).Use barley flour to dust your rolling surface in order to prevent the lefse from sticking (a trick shared with visitors at Oslo's Norske Folkemuseum). Hardanger lefse will keep, unrefrigerated, for six months; to serve, either steam the bread between wet paper towels for a minute or two in the microwave or moisten it with water and allow to rest between damp towels until softened.To make homemade Hardanger lefse, you will need:3 eggs1 cup sugar2 cups buttermilk1/2 cup melted butter (slightly cooled)3/4 cup Swedish light syrup7 cups flour (all-purpose, spelt, or a combination)2 tsp. hartshorn (baker's ammonia) or baking powderBarley flour for dusting rolling pin and counter",
