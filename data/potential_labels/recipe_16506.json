    "Put all the ingredients for the marinade in a food processor and blend to a smooth purée. Mix the marinade thoroughly with the meat (use a spatula!) and refrigerate for a day.",
    "Heat oven to 325° F. Transfer the meat and all the marinade to a Dutch oven bring it up to a boil over medium heat.",
    "Once it has come to a boil, transfer the Dutch oven, uncovered, to the oven and let the meat braise for 1 1/2 hours until the meat is tender, making sure you stir it halfway through. If a lot of fat floats to the surface, go ahead and ladle some of it off and dispose.",
    "Add the potatoes and carrots and cook, covered, until the vegetables are almost tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.",
    "Add the peas and coconut milk and cook for another 30 minutes or so, until the meat is absolutely falling apart. Check for seasoning.",
    "Garnish with chopped cilantro. Enjoy with steamed rice!"
