    "For the chicken: Season cut up chicken with salt & pepper. Set up your breading station: zip-top bag with flour, plate with beaten eggs, & zip-top bag with cornstarch. Dredge chicken in flour, then coat with egg, then shake in cornstarch. Repeat until all chicken is finished.",
    "Start your sauce: combine red jalapeno, garlic, sugar, water, vinegar & salt in a small saucepan. Heat until boiling. Make a slurry with your cornstarch & water & whisk into boiling sauce until thickened. Taste & adjust heat with crushed red pepper flakes if needed. Hold sauce on low temperature.",
    "In a large skillet, heat oil on medium-high heat. Carefully lay chicken strips into the oil. Do half the mixture at a time, so you don't overcrowd your chicken. Cook until golden brown & no longer pink in the middle. Let rest on a paper towel to soak up extra oil. Repeat with other half of chicken. Keep warm. Wash pan.",
    "In the large skillet, that is now clean, add 1 Tbsp canola oil. Saute red bell pepper & onions for 3 minutes. Add pineapples, & the reserved sauce & chicken. Toss everything together until well-coated & heated through. Serve on top of your choice of rice."
