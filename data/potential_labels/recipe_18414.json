    "Add the zucchini and the green and red bell peppers, stir well, cover, and simmer for another 5 minutes. Add the eggplant, tomatoes, and tomato paste and stir again to combine everything together well.",
    "Cover the pan and continue to simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 8 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the veggies are tender and cooked, remove the pan from the heat immediately to make sure the vegetables don't overcook and become soggy."
