    "Place ground turkey, onion, eggs, panko, garlic, cilantro and seasoning go in a bowl. Just make sure you do not over mix. Mix JUUUUUUUST enough for everything to be combined.",
    "Next we prepare to scoop our meatballs out onto a sheet pan. And then I use my neat little trick to make sure my parchment paper for my sheet pan stays ON the sheet pan.",
    "Prepare a sheet pan by spraying it with pan spray and THEN putting parchment on top. Create a huge “X” on the sheet from one corner to the next. This is a great trick to get your paper to stick onto the sheet pan. I learned THAT in culinary school! See how important education is!?!",
    "X marks the spot isn’t just for treasure maps.",
    "Next...take a melon baller, or a smaller ice cream scoop or a teaspoon and scoop out the meatballs onto the sheet pan.",
    "Leave the edges a little “rougher” do not smooth them out, you will get nice, crispy edges this way.",
    "Place in a 450-degree oven for 12-15 minutes."
