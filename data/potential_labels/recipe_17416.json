    "The best guacamole recipe is so easy to make. Just grab your fresh guacamole ingredients and mash everything together. A Mortar & Pestle is the best way to mix this simple guacamole recipe into the perfect texture and blend the flavors. However, if you donâ€™t have that, you can also use the bottom of a glass & cutting board. When all else fails, a bowl and a fork is an easy way to mash things together."
