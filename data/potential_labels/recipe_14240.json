    "Mince the garlic. Wash and roughly chop the romaine lettuce. Rinse and roughly chop the tomato(es). Rinse and drain the canned pinto beans. Wash and chop the cilantro (if using).",
    "Heat the olive oil in a skillet or pot (with a lid) over medium-high heat. (To make this recipe oil-free, substitute water for olive oil.) Add garlic, and cook for about 1 minute.",
    "Then, add to the skillet: quinoa, water, beans, tomatoes, frozen corn, chili powder and cumin. (Tip: Your water measurement should be 2 times the quinoa measurement.) Stir to combine.",
    "Bring the mixture to a boil. Then, cover with the lid and reduce heat to low.",
    "Simmer until quinoa is cooked (about 15 minutes). Add salt and pepper, and season to taste.",
    "Serve over a bed of fresh romaine and top with lime juice, avocado and cilantro (if using).",
    "Kid-Friendly Tip: Kids love if you wrap the beans and quinoa mixture into an entire leaf of lettuce like a taco! What's better than taco night? If that doesn't work for you, then salads are surprisingly kid-friendly, too! Some children don't love the texture combination of quinoa, beans, and corn. If this is your kid, just heat and plate those items separately."
