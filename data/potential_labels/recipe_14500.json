    "In a medium mixing bowl, mix the jello, and lemon juice with the hot water. Stir until dissolved, then add the cold water. Set the bowl in the fridge until the jello is completely cooled, but not set.",
    "In a separate mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese with the sugar and vanilla until smooth. Slowly add the chilled jello mix, while beating everything together. Once smooth, set in the fridge again, until the mixture begins to thicken- about 1 hour.",
    "Prepare the graham cracker crust by mixing the crumbs with the melted butter and then press it into a large springform pan, minimum of 10 inches. Set in freezer until ready for the crust.",
    "Fold the cool whip into the cream cheese and jello mixture with a rubber scraper. Gently mix until the mixture is smooth and the cool whip is evenly distributed.",
    "Pour the cheesecake mixture into the crust. Let it set in the fridge for at least 6 hours, overnight is best. Do not cover with plastic wrap until the cheesecake is set.",
    "Serve chilled, top each slice with the optional whipped cream and lemon wedge. Keep the cheesecake chilled."
