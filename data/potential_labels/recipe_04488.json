    "Put the first three ingredients in a bowl or in a food processor. If doing this by hand, cut the shortening in until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. If doing this in a food processor, break down the shortening into small pieces by pulsing a few times.",

    "Heat the oil and add the onions.",

    "Add the garlic and saute on low heat for a minute or two until the garlic softens. Donâ€™t let it burn. Turn off heat.",
    "Put tofu, almond milk, chilies and rice flour in a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. Add salt as needed. Add the coriander and pulse once or twice until the leaves are broken down into small pieces but not liquefied.",
    "Pour the tofu mixture into the onions and garlic and mix well.",
    "Now take the pastry dough and either pat into a greased tart pan, preferably one with a removable bottom, or roll it into a circle and place inside the tart pan, trimming off any overhanging edges.",
    "Pour the filling into the pastry shell.",
    "Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven about 35-40 minutes until the filling is set and lightly golden.",
    "Cool on a rack for about 10 minutes before unmoulding. Serve warm."
