    "Rinse off 4 cones and then mash them in a pitcher of cold water and let it sit overnight or about 8-12 hours.",
    "Strain with a fine mesh strainer or coffee filter then drink! You can sweeten to taste.",
    "(You’ll probably find that every batch is a slightly different color ranging from light pink to bright pink. That’s ok – the color is dependent on the color of your particular cones)",
    "I don’t think it needs any additional sweeteners, but if you have a sweet tooth or if your batch is extra tangy, add some honey or other sweetener to taste. Most kids prefer this drink with a little bit of added sweetener, too."
