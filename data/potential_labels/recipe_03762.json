    "Cut the peppers in half from top to bottom. Scrape out the pith and seeds â€“ but if they have stems, leave them on as they are pretty and taking them off will leave a hole in the side of the pepper halves. Blanch the peppers in boiling water for 3 minutes, then drain.",
    "Arrange the peppers on a baking dish and place a tablespoon of black olive tapenade inside each. Use the back of a teaspoon to spread the paste around inside.",
    "Carefully crack an egg into each of the peppers. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the egg is cooked."
