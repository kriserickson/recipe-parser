    "Preheat your oven to 425F. Wash your broccoli and cut off all the little florets from the stem. Slice the top, less woody part of the stem into slices. Peel your garlic cloves and slice each clove into a few slivers. Toss the florets and stem slices and garlic slivers in a bowl with olive oil. Sprinkle with the salt and some pepper and toss again. Spread it all out on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven, stirring occasionally until the broccoli is getting nice and browned on the outside, about 25-30 minutes. When done, remove from the oven and transfer to a serving bowl. Toss the broccoli with the preserved lemon and serve."
