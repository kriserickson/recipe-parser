    "Wash and scrub the turnips under running water. Trip the stem end flat and cut the point off the tip of the turnip as well. Poke the turnip skin several times to avoid rupturing during cooking. Place on microwave turntable. Cook on HI for about 3 minutes. Turn over and cook on HI for about 3 more minutes. They should be thoroughly soft when done. Split and place 2 tsp. butter on each turnip (or more if you can afford the fat grams). You can also add the traditional baked potato toppings like sour cream, cheese, bacon bits and chives/green onion. Those additions, however, are not calculated in the nutritional info below."
