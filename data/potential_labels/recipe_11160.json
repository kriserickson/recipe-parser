    "Put the fruit in a saucepan with the sugar and 125ml water. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat a bit and simmer until soft and pulpy (about 15 minutes). Push through a sturdy sieve or fine strainer (a conical chinois is ideal if you have one) into a bowl, getting as much pulp through as possible. Allow to cool then taste and add more sugar if necessary, or a spritz of lemon juice if you feel your fruits need it.",
    "Stir the icing sugar into the cream then whip into soft peaks. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg white until stiff. Very gently fold this into the cream, then swirl the cooled puree through this. Served immediately, or refrigerate."
