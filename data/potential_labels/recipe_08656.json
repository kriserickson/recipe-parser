    "How to Prepare",
    "Make your brine using 2 liters of cherry Dr. Pepper and 1/2 cup of kosher salt.",
    "Stir the ingredients well until all of the salt is dissolved",
    "Rinse the country style ribs with cold water",
    "Place the pork country style ribs into a large 1-gallon zip top bag",
    "Pour the brine over the ribs into the zip top bag and zip closed.",
    "Note: it is smart to place the bag down into a bowl to catch any accidental leaks.",
    "Brine the meat in the fridge for about 2 hours or up to 8 hours if you want to do them overnight.",
    "Once the brining process is finished, rinse the meat well using cold water and lay them out so they can be seasoned with my rub",
    "Normally, I like to use yellow mustard, oil, or some other sticky substance on the meat to help the rub to stick but just to show you that you don’t have to do that if you have a little extra time, I am adding the rub directly to the meat without anything else.",
    "Apply my rub generously to the top side of the meat and wait for them to get a “wet” look before you flip them over to do the other side.",
    "After about 10 minutes or so, I flipped the ribs over and applied my rub generously to the other side.",
    "In about another 10 minutes or so, we had the “wet” look that we were waiting for and they were ready to smoke.",
    "Does that look good or what!"
