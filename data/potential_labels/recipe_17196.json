    "Melt the Butter: You can melt the butter on the stove, constantly stirring over medium heat, or melt it in the microwave by heating it for 10 seconds at a time. Cut it into small pieces, so it melts faster. Butter burns easily, so remove it from the heat when most of the butter has melted, and stir until the remaining portion has melted.",
    "Pour the Melted Butter Into the Milk, and Stir.",
    "Use Your Substitute in Place of One Cup of Heavy Cream: If you used low-fat milk, your mixture would be a bit thinner than you want it to be. Just add a tablespoon of flour to thicken it."
