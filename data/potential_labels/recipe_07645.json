Using a mandoline slicer or a very sharp knife, slice sprouts as thinly as possible (I'm talking like 1/16 of a inch). Discard ends and any large core pieces or chunks. Place shaved sprouts in a large bowl. Toss with apples and remaining dressing. Set aside and let sit for at least 15 minutes or more.",
