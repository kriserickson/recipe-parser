    "Break or chop the chocolate into little pieces and melt in a large bowl (big enough to take all the Rice Krispies later) suspended over a pan of simmering water, making sure the water doesn't actually touch the bowl. Over low heat, this will take about 4 minutes. Be patient and do not stir the melting chocolate, though you can use a spatula to fold gently just once.",
    "Once the chocolate has melted, add the butter and syrup and stand for a minute or so before gently folding in, then remove the bowl from the pan.",
    "Pour in the Rice Krispies and then fold briskly until everything is combined and turn into your foil tray. If your receptacle is not foil, then you'd be wise to line it with foil.",
    "Smooth the mixture in the tray to make an even layer and then press on the sugar flowers, should you be using them. Put in the fridge to set; this will take 1-2 hours depending on how cold your fridge is.",
    "Cut into large or little squares or slices, as wished.",
    "Additional information - for gluten free please note that Rice Krispies contain barley malt so replace them with a gluten free puffed rice cereal."
