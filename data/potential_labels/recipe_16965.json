    "In a small sauce pan, heat the almond milk to a boil. Remove the milk from the heat and set it aside.",
    "In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until it is fluffy and pale yellow. Next add the cornstarch to the egg mixture and whisk until there are no lumps. Now, whisk a little bit of the warm milk into the egg mixture and mix completely. Slowly pour the rest of the milk into the egg mixture while it is being whisked. Next, pour the egg mixture through a strainer back into the sauce pan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it comes just to a boil and it has thickened. Take off the heat and stir in the Stevia.",
    "Pour the mixture into a container, cover the top of the pastry cream with plastic wrap sprayed with a little cooking spray (place the plastic directly on the top of the cream so it does not form a skin). Allow to cool. If you are going to use it immediately, just leave it out. If it will be a while, refrigerate it and remove it from the refrigerator about an hour before using."
