    "Slice sweet potatoes lengthwise into 1/4 inch slices. Add to the toaster like you would bread and toast on high. It took me 2 rounds to get it cooked how I like with a little bit a browning on both sides.",
    "Remove skin from avocado and slice. Add to toast and sprinkle with salt, pepper and some lemon zest.",
    "Spread some almond butter on toast and add sliced banana and a bit of cinnamon.",
    "I added 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon relish and 1 tablespoon of diced red onion to a small can of tuna. Scoop tuna onto toast!"
