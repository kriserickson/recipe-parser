    "1. Melt the butter in a large frying pan over a low heat, add the leek, season it with salt and pepper, then cover with a lid and cook gently for five minutes or until softened.",
    "2. Rinse the scallops thoroughly, then pat dry on kitchen paper and season on both sides. Tip the sesame seeds onto a plate and press the flat side of each scallop into them.",
    "3. For the chocolate dressing, pour the vinegar, sake and soy sauce into a small saucepan and heat to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat, add the chocolate and stir until it has melted and become smooth.",
    "4. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the scallops, flat-side down. Fry them for about 30 seconds on each side, depending on their size, or until just tender and lightly golden. Serve immediately on a bed of the warm leeks with a drizzle of the chocolate dressing and the rest alongside.",
    "Tip: Don’t be tempted to overcrowd the pan or the temperature will drop and the scallops will boil rather than caramelise, so do this in batches or two pans if necessary"
