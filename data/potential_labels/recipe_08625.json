    "Preheat your oven to 350 F.",
    "Empty the cake mix into a large bowl. Measure out 1/2 cup vegetable oil and crack the eggs into it - beat with a fork until nice and yellow.",
    "Pour the oil/egg mix into the dry and mix it well with a spatula. It'll take a bit of stirring to come together - make sure there are no dry spots left! The dough will be fairly stiff and glossy.",
    "Measuring out the dough",
    "Use a tablespoon measure and scoop the dough onto baking sheets. A normal box of cake mix will give you 24 cookies - do 12 on each baking sheet.",
    "Baking!",
    "Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes at 350 F. They will be puffy and look like they're not done when they first come out of the oven, but will flatten and firm up as they cool. They should be nicely browned on the bottom but stay light on top.",
    "They dry out super fast if you keep them in the oven too long, so be careful."
