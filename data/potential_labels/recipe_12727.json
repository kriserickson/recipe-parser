    "Beat egg whites, then add yolks and beat until fluffy.",
    "Holding by the stem, carefully pass each chile through flour and then dip completely in the egg batter. Fry in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown. Drain on paper towel.",
    "Sauté garlic and onions with one teaspoon oil until tender. Add oregano and tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes on low heat. Let cool slightly then puree in blender or food processor. Return to skillet, add Crema Mexicana and heat through. Serve over chile rellenos."
