  "ingredients": [
    "0",
    "1 cup flour",
    "1 egg replacer (Can be store bought or you can use 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar & 1 tsp baking soda)",
    "2 cups fresh spinach/kale/nappa cabbage/ or your green of choice [minced] 3/4 cup rice milk or water",
    "1/4 tsp salt",
    "Okonomi sauce – If you don’t have access to a Japanese market near you (or can’t order ingredients online), don’t worry, there are lots of sauces that taste good on top. Katsu sauce, aka tonkatsu sauce is great, even teriyaki sauce is delicious. Those can usually be found in the international or Asian sections of your local grocery store.",
    "This is your base recipe. Okonomiyaki literally means “as you like it”. So you can add whatever you like at this stage, your favorite foods or leftovers from previous meals. Things like green onions, shallots, ginger, garlic, seaweed, etc are great examples."
