    "The night before you want to eat the steak, trim any fat off of the flank steak and slice it into strips.",
    "Combine all the other ingredients into a gallon size ziploc bag and shake until mixed together. Add the steak to the bag, seal, and shake the bag until the steak is covered in the marinade. Refrigerate overnight, shaking the bag once or twice to get everything stirred together.",
    "When you're ready to eat, place the steak on a preheated and oiled grill or grill pan on a stove. Grill on medium-high heat until desired doneness, turning the steak often. You'll want to grill it for about 8-10 minutes for medium temperature but check the progress often so you cook it how you like it!"
