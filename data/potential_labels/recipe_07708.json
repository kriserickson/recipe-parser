    "Preheat oven to 400°F. Divide beets between 2 pieces of foil; bring edges together and crimp to make packets. Roast until beets are just tender when pierced with the point of a knife, about 1 1⁄4 hours. Unwrap beets and let cool.",
    "Meanwhile, whisk oil, vinegar, mustard, honey, salt and pepper in a small bowl to make dressing.",
    "When the beets are cool enough to handle, slip off the skins. Cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes and place in a large bowl. Add celery, shallot and the dressing; toss to coat well. Serve at room temperature or chilled.",
    "Makes 8 servings, 1⁄2 cup each."
