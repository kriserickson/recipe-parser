    "For the dressing:",
    "In a medium mixing bowl whisk together all dressing ingredients. Cover and chill until ready to use.",
    "For the salad:",
    "Add all salad ingredients to a salad bowl (I like to set aside about 1/4 of the bacon and red onion to sprinkle over the top at the end for more color, that's totally optional), pour dressing over top then toss to evenly coat. Serve within and hour of adding dressing for best results."
