    "Melt coconut butter in a double boiler (a microwave might work as well).",
    "Add maple syrup (or any other liquid sweetener) and give it a mix with a spoon or whisk.",
    "Also, add lemon juice and lemon zest and mix again.",
    "Now add the shredded unsweetened coconut and stir with a spoon. The mixture will thicken and it shouldn't be too wet or sticky. If you believe it's too sticky or wet, simply add a little more coconut.",
    "Stir in the cranberries and put the mixture into the freezer for about 5 minutes. This will make the mixture firmer and better manageable.",
    "Use your hands to roll half to one tablespoon (depending on which size you prefer) of the mixture into balls. It works best with slightly damp hands. Enjoy! Store leftovers in the fridge or freezer!"
