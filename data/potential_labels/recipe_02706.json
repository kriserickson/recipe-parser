    "In a large cast iron or nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add the gnocchi and cook, stirring frequently, until starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Set aside.",
    "Using the same skillet, heat the remaining oil and then saute the shallots and mushrooms until the onion is golden and the mushrooms have released their juices, about 5 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high and stir in the tomatoes, roasted red pepper, cayenne and black pepper. Cook, stirring, until the tomatoes are hot and beginning to split their skins a bit, about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the gnocchi and basil, and sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese. Turn the heat to medium-low, cover the skillet and then cook until the cheese has just melted, about 2 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately."
