    "Set oven to 420F/216C.",
    "Cook bulgur wheat according to the instructions given on the package. TIP: to add more flavor to the bulgur wheat, cook it using vegetable stock. Set aside and allow to cool once finished.",
    "Place roasted veggies on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Spray with a little olive oil and add a pinch of sea salt & pepper. Roast in the oven for 15 – 20 minutes, or until the veggies are crisp tender and the outside edges are browned slightly. Set aside to cool once finished.",
    "In a large bowl, mix together the ingredients for the tabbouleh – except for the oil, garlic, herbs and lemon juice – using a wooden spatula. Mix together the oil, garlic, oregano, lemon and sea salt & pepper in a separate small bowl or cup. Add the roasted vegetables to the tabbouleh, then pour in the oil. Gently fold everything together.",
    "Set a nonstick skillet on medium-high heat. Season the chicken breasts, spray the skillet with olive oil once hot, then add the chicken to the skillet. Sear the chicken on one side for 3 to 4 minutes, then flip the chicken over and bake in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.",
    "Mix together the ingredients for the tahini sauce, it should be creamy, thick yet somewhat runny. If you need it to be thinner, simply add tablespoons of water (or lemon) until you reach your desired consistency.",
    "Build your meals and drizzle tahini sauce on top!"
