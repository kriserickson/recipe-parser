    "In a food processor fitted with the S blade, blend the walnuts into a fine meal. Add the dates and process until crumbly. Divide a little over 3 tablespoons of the mixture between 5 small jars and press up/into the sides. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.",
    "Place the dates on a small plate and mash the shit out of them with a fork (this may take up to 5 minutes) until they turn into a lumpy paste. Add a bit (1 tablespoon) of the 1/3 cup of water and continue mashing until smooth. Scrape date mash into a small bowl and stir in remaining water until combined. Pass through a fine mesh strainer (to remove chunks) then stir in salt. Transfer caramel to an air tight jar and refrigerate until ready to use. Will keep for up to three days. Stir before using.",
    "Prepare the banana cream by adding the cashews and bananas to the base of a high speed blender, such as a Vitamix; blend for 30 seconds. Add the dates, milk, lemon juice, and salt; mix on high speed for 30-45 seconds, scraping down the sides as needed. Divide the cream mixture between the jars and drizzle with salted caramel. Chill for at least an hour. Best served within 24 hours, but will last for up to three days in the refrigerator. Top with banana slices and walnut pieces (if desired) just before serving. If freezing, consume within two weeks and thaw before serving.",
