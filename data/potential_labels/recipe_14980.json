    "1 Prep the cucumbers: Slice the cucumbers in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds in the middle, discard the seeds. If using rather large cucumbers, slice them again lengthwise. Then cut them crosswise into 1/4-inch to 1/2 inch slices.",
    "Place in a large bowl and sprinkle with a teaspoon of kosher salt. Toss to distribute the salt evenly around the cucumber pieces.",
    "Let sit for 20 to 25 minutes while the salt helps pull excess moisture out of the cucumbers.",
    "Then rinse off the salt, drain the cucumbers, and squeeze out more excess moisture with paper towels.",
    "2Â Toast the slivered almonds in a small pan over medium-high heat, tossing them often, until they start to brown and smell good. Move to a bowl to cool.",
    "3 Combine: Mix the cucumbers, almonds, garlic, grapes, olive oil, and vinegar together in a large bowl and add more salt to taste. Garnish with chives and serve."
