    "Preheat oven to 350. Mix all the ingredients except cranberries together in a large bowl and beat with a hand mixer. Add the cranberries. Pour the mix into a loaf pan lined with parchment paper. (I use this unbleached kind.) Bake for 35-40 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. In my oven this was 37 minutes exactly, but all ovens vary.",
    "This bread is sweetly delicious and is great choice for your holiday breakfast or dessert."
