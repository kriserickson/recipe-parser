    "Preparation:",
    "In a heavy bottom cooking pot sauté onions, garlic, carrots and parsnips for about 4-5 minutes.",
    "Place cubed beef on the vegetable bed and let it brown well on all sides.",
    "Slightly cover pan and keep sautéing beef and vegetables together for 20-30 minutes. Beef will release juices, so just let everything slowly simmer until all liquid evaporates.",
    "Soon you will hear a frying sound. Make sure you stir well so beef or vegetables don’t burn.",
    "Now is the time to add spices: vegeta, salt, paprika and pepper. Stir once again and make sure meat is well coated with spices.",
    "Add water, bring it to boil and then turn down to medium cover and let is simmer for 2 – 2.5 hours. Some of the water will evaporate, so make sure to check the pot every 20-30 minutes to see if you need to add any water. Meat needs to be covered with water at all times while simmering.",
    "The last 45 minutes of cooking add peeled and cubed rutabaga; adjust spices if needed. Serve warm , garnished with fresh parsley."
