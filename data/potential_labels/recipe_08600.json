    "Sauté onion in ghee and coconut oil over medium heat for 5-6 minutes, until softened and slightly golden.",
    "Add the ginger, squash and garlic and stir through for a minute. Add the spices and stir through. Then add the fish sauce, stock, coconut cream, lime juice, salt and sesame seeds and stir through. Bring to boil, turn down to medium-low and cover with a lid. Cook for about 8-10 minutes.",
    "In the meantime, either chop or grind the cauliflower florets into small crumbs. I used a food processor and added separated florets in three batches, whizzed a few times for a couple of seconds each time, until finely chopped up but not completely ground up into dust. You can use a knife and chop the cauli super finely.",
    "After 8-10 minutes of cooking the pumpkin, stir in the cauliflower rice and cook together for 5 minutes, covered with a lid. Stir a couple of times.",
    "Using a potato masher, press down the cooked mixture a few times to soften the pumpkin pieces slightly. You want some of the pumpkin flesh to become the sauce itself.",
    "Serve with fresh coriander and a dollop of coconut cream or yoghurt. A few sesame seeds over the top for presentation."
