    "Heat milk until about to boil. Remove from heat, stir in vinegar, and set aside to cool for half an hour. NOTE: As the milk curdles, slightly greenish whey will form alongside the milk curdles. This is normal.",
    "Line a sieve/colander with cheesecloth, pour the cheese in, and let the whey drain. Hold the ends of cheesecloth together and squeeze lightly to drain more of the whey. Set whey aside if saving.",
    "Run cool water over sieve/colander for a few minutes, stirring cheese with your fingers as you rinse the cheese. Allow to drain further for 10 minutes. Cheese is ready to be used or stored in the fridge in a clean, covered container. For a more commercial taste and texture, you will need to add some salt and cream (or milk for a lower fat alternative)."
