    "Heat oil in small skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and chopped rosemary; sauté until golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl. Add sausage, mustard, and generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Mix gently. Form into twelve 2-inch-diameter patties. Arrange sausages on heavy baking sheet. (Can be made 1 day ahead; chill.)",
    "Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 500°F. Bake sausages until just cooked through, about 6 minutes. (If sausages have not browned, broil 2 minutes.) Transfer sausages to paper towels to drain, then arrange on platter. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and serve."
