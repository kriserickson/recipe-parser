    "Place almonds in a food processor and turn on. Almonds will go through different stages but you will want to let your food processor run until the oil has released and almond butter has smoothed out (it will ball up right before this happens). Turn off food processor and transfer to a mason jar.",
    "Stir in salt and honey; taste. Adjust sweet/salty combination to your liking. Cover with an airtight lid and keep in the refrigerator."
