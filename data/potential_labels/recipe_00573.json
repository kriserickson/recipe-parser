    "First make the halloumi parcels. Heat\noven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Grease\n2 baking trays with oil. In a bowl, mix\nthe tahini, olive oil, chilli, parsley and\nlemon zest. Add the halloumi and toss\neverything well to coat – don’t worry\nif the halloumi breaks up a little.",
    "Cut the filo sheets in half so that you\nhave 12 squares – work with 2 at a time\nand keep the remaining pastry covered\nwith a damp tea towel or cling film so it\ndoesn’t dry out. Lightly brush the filo all\nover with a little oil, place 2 slices of\nhalloumi at the top of each square,\nsprinkle with sesame seeds, then fold\nover the edges to enclose the halloumi.\nBrush again with oil and sprinkle with\nmore seeds. Fold up into a square,\nbrushing the final edge with egg to help\nseal the parcel. When all the parcels are\nmade, place on the baking trays, brush\nthe tops with egg wash and sprinkle with\nmore sesame seeds. Bake for 20 mins,\nswapping the trays over halfway through\nso that the parcels brown evenly.",
    "Meanwhile, make the mash. Put the\nsweet potato in a large pan of water,\ncover with a lid and boil for 10-12 mins\nuntil tender. Drain, reserving a little of\nthe cooking water, and leave to steamdry.\nTip the sweet potato into a food\nprocessor with the tahini, olive oil and\nplenty of seasoning. Whizz until smooth,\nadding enough of the cooking water to\nmake a smooth purée. To make the salad,\nwhisk together the lemon juice, honey\nand olive oil in a large bowl with some\nseasoning. Add the remaining ingredients\nand toss everything together.",
    "Spoon some of the sweet potato onto\neach plate. Add a pile of the herb salad\nand 2 halloumi parcels to each plate and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil."
