    "1. Start this the night before you want to have steel-cut oatmeal. Measure out your oats. This quantity will make about 4 servings.",
    "2. Heat about 1 teaspoon butter or olive oil in a 2-quart saucepan set over medium heat. Add the oats and fry them for about 3 minutes, or until they start smelling toasty.",
    "3. Pour in the water and add the salt. Stir.",
    "4. Bring to a rolling boil.",
    "5. Turn off the heat and cover the pan. Leave it on the stove, and go to bed!",
    "6. The next morning, uncover the pan and bring the oatmeal back up to a simmer. If you would like thinner and creamier oatmeal, stir in a cup of milk before reheating.",
    "When the oatmeal is warm, scoop out and enjoy!",
    "Additional Notes: • Cover and refrigerate any leftovers. • Re-heat leftovers in just the same way: warm up on the stove, or in a bowl in the microwave."
