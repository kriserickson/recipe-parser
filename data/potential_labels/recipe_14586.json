    "I used the frozen already riced cauliflower. It was a busy evening and I was in a hurry and needed a shortcut. I steamed the bags according to the package directions.",
    "Add the cooked cauliflower to the skillet of sausage. Pour in the beef broth and stir. If you are making your own riced cauliflower and it is not cooked---you will want to add more beef broth so the cauliflower can cook and get tender.",
    "Lastly, add salt and pepper to the mixture to your liking and heat on low-medium heat until the mixture is well heated."
