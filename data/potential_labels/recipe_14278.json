    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).",
    "Cut tomatoes and onions into wedges and remove some of the tomato seeds with your fingers. Remove seeds from red pepper and cut into even slices.",
    "Place all of the veggies, including the garlic, on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, a generous pinch of sea salt and black pepper and toss. Roast for 40-45 minutes, or until the veggies are tender, lightly browned and close to half their original size. Remove from oven and set aside.",
    "In a large pot over medium to medium-high heat, add canned tomatoes, veggie broth, tomato paste, the slightly-drained vine-ripened tomatoes and the roasted veggies. Add another pinch of salt and pepper, stir and bring to a low boil.",
    "Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Then use an immersion blender, food processor or blender to puree your soup (leave some whole veggies if you prefer more texture).",
    "Return to pot and add 1/2 cup plain almond milk (and more broth if itâ€™s too thick for your liking). You can also sub cream or regular milk.",
    "Cook for 5-10 minutes more on medium to medium-low heat and serve warm.",
    "Optional garnishes: pesto, oregano, parsley, roasted red pepper flake, vegan parmesan cheese, basil, garlic croutons. Will keep in the fridge for several days."
