    "For the chicken: Mix together Old Bay, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Pat chicken wings dry with paper towels. Place wings in a large bowl and sprinkle with Old Bay mixture, tossing to coat evenly. Arrange wings in a single layer on wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Refrigerate uncovered for at least 8 hours.",
    "To make the sauce: Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in hot sauce and Worcestershire. Remove from heat and seat aside.",
    "Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Place the wings skin side up over the cool side of the grill, cover, and cook until skins are crisp and are starting to brown, 30 to 40 minutes.",
    "Transfer wings to a large bowl. Add in sauce and toss to thoroughly coat. Transfer to a serving tray and serve immediately."
