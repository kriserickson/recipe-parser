    "1 Soak the dates in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes: When ready their skin should easily to peel off with your fingers. Strain the dates from the soaking liquid, reserving the liquid.",
    "2 Peel the dates and remove the seeds: Peel the skins off all the dates with your fingers. Split them open (you should be able to just pinch them open; otherwise use a paring knife). Remove the pit.",
    "3 Puree the dates until creamy: Put the dates into the bowl of a food processor or blender. Add the vanilla, 2 tablespoons of the reserved soaking water, and salt. Process until very smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl every couple of minutes. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little water until you reach a smooth, spoonable consistency.",
    "4 For a creamier sauce, add coconut cream: Add the coconut cream at the very end and pulse 10 times to incorporate.",
    "5 Taste and adjust as needed: Taste the sauce. Add lemon juice or more salt if needed."
