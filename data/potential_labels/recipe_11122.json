    "An easy way to cook frozen chicken in a skillet is to lightly coat the bottom of the skillet with oil (preferably olive oil, as it is the healthiest for you), and preheat the pan to medium high heat. Once the pan is preheated, place the chicken in the pan and season the chicken to your liking and then add about a half of a cup of water, making sure not to wash away the seasonings. Cover the pan and allow it to simmer for about 20 minutes and then flip. Be aware that the chicken may stick a little so it is better to loosen it up before flipping. To ensure that the chicken cooks all the way through and to speed up the process, it is beneficial to cut a few slits through each piece. After that, simply cover it back up and allow about 15 more minutes of cook time."
