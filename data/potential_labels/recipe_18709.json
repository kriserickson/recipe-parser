    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "In a heavy pan with lid, cook the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat. While browning the meat, use a wooden spatula to break it up into small pieces. Once the meat is fully cooked, drain off all the fat.",
    "With the cooked meat still in the pan, add in the olive oil, onion, celery, bell pepper and garlic. Continue cooking until the veggies are tender. Add in the canned mushrooms (drained), Italian parsley, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, beef broth, apple cider vinegar, sugar, all of the spices and the bay leaves. Stir well until all ingredients are fully incorporated. Bring the spaghetti sauce to a brief boil, then cover the pot with a lid and dial down the heat to low. Allow the meat sauce to continue to simmer for 2-1/2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally.",
    "Remove the two bay leaves from the pot. If desired, sprinkle the sauce with a bit of additional fresh parsley and parmesan cheese. Serve over spaghetti or your favorite pasta. This homemade spaghetti sauce is also perfect for making lasagna."
