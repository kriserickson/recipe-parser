    "Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add sweet potato to pan; saut√© 3 minutes. Decrease heat to medium. Add cauliflower, onion, and curry powder; cook 1 minute, stirring mixture constantly. Add broth and next 3 ingredients (through tomatoes); bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with cilantro; serve with yogurt.",
    "Wine match: Viognier. Tangent 2008 Paragon Vineyard Viognier (Edna Valley, CA; $17) is your must-try wine here, with notes of gardenia, peach, and apricot. It is full-bodied enough to meet the chickpeas halfway but crisp enough to hold up to the tangy tomatoes and yogurt. --Sara Schneider"
