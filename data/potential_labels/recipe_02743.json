    "In a large pot over medium-high heat, brown the meat with the onion, celery, and garlic. Remove the pot from the heat and drain off as much fat as you can. (Discard the fat once it cools.)",
    "Return the pot to the heat and add the rest of the ingredients. Stir to combine, then bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, then cover the pot and simmer the soup for 15-20 more minutes, until potatoes are tender but not overly mushy.",
    "Soup should be somewhat thick, but if you'd like it to be more \"soupy,\" add 1 to 2 cups more broth OR hot water and heat through. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more salt if needed.",
    "Serve with crusty bread!"
