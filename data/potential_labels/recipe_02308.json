    "In a bowl beat together eggs and garlic powder. In a 10-inch skillet melt margarine or butter over medium heat. Pour in egg mixture. Cook, without stirring until mixture begins to set on the bottom and around the edges. Using a large spoon or spatula, lift and fold partially cooked eggs so uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until eggs are cooked throughout but are still glossy and moist.",
    "Add tortilla chips, enchilada sauce, and olives. Stir gently to combine. Sprinkle with cheese; cover and cook over low heat about 5 minutes or until heated through. Serve immediately dolloped with sour cream and sprinkled with green onion, if desired. Makes 4 or 5 servings."
