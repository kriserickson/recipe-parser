    "Add the Oreo cookies and melted butter to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the cookies are reduced to fine crumbs.",
    "With a spatula, transfer the cookie crumb mixture to a 9- or 10-inch pie dish. Spread the mixture evenly on the bottom and sides of the pie dish. Press down firmly with your spatula to compact the Oreo cookie crust.",
    "For no-bake recipes, refrigerate the Oreo cookie crust for 30-40 minutes before adding the filling. For a slightly firmer, crispier crust - bake it for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Remove the pie dish from the oven and allow the Oreo cookie crust to cool completely before adding the filling. Enjoy!"
