    "Peel three medium apples. Grate the apples and drizzle the juice of half a lemon over the shredded apple. Place shredded apples in a colander over a bowl and leave for 10 minutes while you assemble the rest of the ingredients.",
    "Beat the eggs and add the flour , sugar and spices. Whisk until no lumps remain. Press some of the excess juices out of the resting apples and add to the egg and flour mixture.",
    "Over medium heat, melt half of the butter in a heavy bottom skillet and add just a dash of oil. This will help the butter not burn. Dollop large tablespoonfuls of apple batter into the hot butter and fry like pancakes, flipping once. Serve with maple syrup and sour cream."
