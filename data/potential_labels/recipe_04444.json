    "Combine the oil, garlic powder, chili powder, onion powder, coriander, salt, cumin, and chipotle puree in a gallon size zip-top bag. Squish until mixed well. Add the chicken, zip bag shut, and squish the bag around until all the chicken pieces are covered with the marinade. Refrigerate a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes.",
    "Grill each chicken breast for 4 to 5 minutes per side on medium heat, or until the thickest part of the chicken breast reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "While the chicken is grilling, warm the honey in the microwave so it's runny (15 seconds) and add the cider vinegar. Reserve 2 Tablespoons to drizzle on just before eating. Baste each side of the chicken breast right at the end of grilling. Enjoy!"
