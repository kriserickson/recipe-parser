    "Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Cut squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds (and save for roasting). Rub flesh of squash lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place cut side down on parchment-lined baking sheet, and roast until tender, 30 to 45 minutes depending on the size of the squash. Set aside to cool. Note: I did this the night before, but the farro takes so long to turn into risotto, that you could certainly do this while the farro is cooking — whatever's easiest for you.",
    "Place stock in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat so that it's hot but not simmering.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large, wide sauté pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it's translucent, about five minutes. Add the garlic, and cook for another minute. Add the farro and cook stirring constantly for another minute. Add the wine and let it reduce until it's nearly gone. Add ½ cup of the warm stock, reduce the heat to medium, and stir until the liquid is almost absorbed. Continue cooking, adding ½ cup of warm stock at a time, stirring to prevent scorching and letting each addition be absorbed before adding the next, until the farro grains have expanded and are al dente, about 1 hour. The farro will look creamy like risotto.",
    "Meanwhile, purée the flesh of the squash (discard the skin, which should pull off easily) with enough stock until it's a smooth, silky consistency — I used about a cup of stock. (Note: you will have lots of leftover purée. Freeze it or turn it into soup.)",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the kale: remove the stems and ribs from the leaves. Make stacks of the leaves, roll them into cylinders, and cut them into very thin ribbons. Wash and dry the kale if necessary.",
    "Stir one cup of the squash purée into the risotto. Add a handful of the thinly sliced kale strips and stir until the kale is wilted. Add more kale to taste — a small handful was enough for me, but add as much as you like. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the cheese. Stir, taste, adjust seasoning, and serve."
