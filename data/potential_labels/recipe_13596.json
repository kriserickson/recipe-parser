    "Heat a large pot fitted with a candy thermometer over medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Once hot, add the potatoes in batches and fry until golden, about 1 to 2 minutes or so, depending on thickness. Remove the fries and place them on a paper-towel lined plate to drain excess grease. Repeat with remaining potatoes. I like to do a double fry so the potatoes are crisp, so add them back to the pot in batches once they are all fried once.",
    "Once you remove the fries from the oil, immediately sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Drizzle with the chimichurri liberally and cover with the gorgonzola cheese. Serve right away.",

    "Combine the parsley, cilantro, oregano and garlic in a food processor and pulse until small leaves and pieces remain. Add in the vinegar and pulse once more. With the processor going, stream in the olive oil and mix until just combined. Stir in the salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. Taste and season additionally if needed. Store sealed in the fridge for up to a week or so."
