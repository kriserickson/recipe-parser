    "On a cutting board, sprinkle the garlic cloves with the salt, then mash/chop into a paste with a knife. In a small bowl combine the garlic paste with the yogurt, dill, and mint. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. When you're all set -stir in the cucumber, and salt to taste. Spoon into a favorite dish and serve drizzled with the olive oil, sprinkled with the walnuts, rose petals, and dried cranberries.",
