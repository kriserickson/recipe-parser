    "Whisk together the flour, wheat germ, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl. Mash the bananas until very smooth in a separate medium bowl. Add the granulated sugar, oil, yogurt, vanilla and egg to the banana and whisk until smooth. Sift the dry ingredients over the wet and fold together with a spatula until just combined. Scrape the batter into a 7-inch round air fryer insert, metal cake pan or foil pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle the top of the batter with the turbinado sugar if desired, for a crunchy, sweet topping.",
    "Put the pan in a 5.3-quart air fryer and cook at 310 degrees F, turning the pan halfway through, until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the bread comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer the pan to a rack to cool for 10 minutes. Unmold the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely on the rack before slicing into wedges to serve."
