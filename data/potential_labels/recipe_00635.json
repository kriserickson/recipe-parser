    "In a mug place the chopped dates and water. Place in microwave for 50 sec until the dates are softened.",
    "Add the Bicarb soda to the mug and let it sit for a minute and mash roughly with a fork.",
    "Add the butter into the mug and place again in the microwave for 10-15 sec to soften and melt.",
    "Add the sugar, flour and egg to the mug and mix to combine thoroughly with a spoon. Flatten the top of the mixture and sprinkle the walnuts on top.",
    "Place in the microwave on a saucer for 1 minute. It may need a further 10-20 sec to finish it off completely, depending on your microwave.",
    "Basic Caramel Sauce: In an ovenproof ramekin add the extra sugar, butter and milk/cream and place in the microwave for 20-30 seconds. Remove and stir and repeat another two to three times depending on your microwave. You will end up with a dark caramel sauce. Drizzle over the sticky date cups and enjoy!"
