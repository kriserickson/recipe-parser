    "To a blender or mixing bowl, add buckwheat flour (see notes), flaxseed meal, dairy-free milk, salt, avocado oil, cinnamon (omit for savory), and sweetener of choice (omit for savory or unsweetened).",
    "Pulse in blender or whisk in mixing bowl to combine. The batter should be pourable but not watery. If too thin, add a bit more buckwheat flour. If too thick, thin with more dairy-free milk.",
    "Heat a cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat. (Non-stick is best for crepes, but I use a seasoned cast-iron skillet and it works well, too). Once hot, add oil (omit for non-stick pan), ~1/4 cup (60 ml) batter, and swirl the batter around the pan so it forms a thin circle. Let cook until the top appears bubbly and the edges are dry (similar to pancakes). Then carefully flip and cook for 2-3 minutes more on the other side. Turn heat down if cooking too quickly.",
    "Repeat until all crepes are prepared - about 12. Keep warm between layers of parchment paper or on a plate under a towel.",
    "Serve as is with a little vegan butter, nut butter, maple syrup, compote, or other fillings or choice! I went with compote, peanut butter, and maple syrup. But these would also be delicious with coconut whipped cream, Cinnamon Baked Apples, fresh fruit (e.g. berries or bananas), or granola.",
    "Best when fresh, but you can store leftovers sealed in the refrigerator up to 3 days. To freeze, layer between pieces of parchment paper (to prevent sticking) and freeze. Then store in a freezer-safe container up to 1 month. To reheat, warm in a 350-degree F (176C) oven or microwave until hot."
