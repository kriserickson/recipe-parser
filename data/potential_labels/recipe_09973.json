    "Directions:",
    "Marinate the salmon in the oil, vinegar, soy sauce and 1 tsp. salt for 30 mins.",
    "Defrost spinach and squeeze out most of the liquid. Mix in the egg, black pepper, garlic and 1 tsp. salt.",
    "Layer 3 sheets of phyllo, brushing with butter/margarine between each layer. Then cut the stack in half.",
    "Place a piece of salmon in the center and top with ¼ of the spinach mixture. Wrap the pastry around it like a packet, and place on baking tray.",
    "Repeat with the other half of the dough, and then again with the 3 remaining sheets, until all 4 pieces of salmon have been wrapped.",
    "Brush the top and sides of the phyllo packets with more butter/margarine. Bake on 375F until pastry is golden and salmon is cooked through—approximately 15 minutes, but timing will vary depending on the thickness of your salmon.",
    "NOTE: If you want to make more than 4, you can increase the salmon up to 8 fillets (using an additional 6 sheets of phyllo) without increasing the rest of the ingredients."
