    "How to Make Bell Pepper egg-in-a-hole for Breakfast:",
    "1. In a large, non-stick skillet, heat 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium/high heat.",
    "2. Cut peppers into 1/2″ rings and remove the seeds and centers. Place sliced peppers into the pan and let them saute for a minute.",
    "3. Crack one egg into the center of each bell pepper slice. Start pouring the egg in slowly; it prevents the egg from leaking and forms a nice seal, but some will leak no matter what; don’t fuss over it; it will still taste great!",
    "4. Sprinkle salt and pepper over each egg. Saute for 3 minutes, then flip it over carefully.",
    "5. Top with a generous amount of parmesan.",
    "6. If you want your yolks to be juicy (over easy), cook another minute."
