    "Combine everything except coconut milk in your slow cooker. Stir. Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 6 hours.",
    "Once the soup is done cooking, use an immersion blender to puree the soup until it is very smooth and all of the vegetable chunks pieces are blended. If you don't have an immersion blender, you can also puree the soup in your blender in batches. Just be very careful when transferring the soup to blender, as it will be very hot.",
