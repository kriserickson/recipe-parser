    "In a bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut, and salt.",
    "Add ¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon of honey to all of the coconut oil and all of the lemon extract. Mix until well combined.",
    "Using a rounded \"measuring\" tablespoon, gently press the macaroon dough into the spoon, then turn the spoon upside down and tap the cookie out into your hand. If it falls apart add one more tablespoon honey. Gently place on a parchment lined baking sheet and repeat with the rest of the dough.",
    "Bake in a 195-200F (90-93C) oven for about 45-50 minutes. The outside should be dried out a bit and the inside should be soft and chewy. For raw macaroons, place in your dehydrator until they are slightly dry on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Times will vary depending on the dehydrator and temp used.",
    "Allow the macaroons to sit for at least 15 minute before transferring. They delicate while still warm but very sturdy once cooled. We LOVE our macaroons chilled."
