    "Spray a large deep frying pan over a medium-high heat with some cooking oil spray.",
    "Add the onion and fry for a couple of minutes until translucent and softened.",
    "Spray into the pan with a little more cooking oil spray.",
    "Add in the mushrooms and garlic, spread out in the pan with a wooden spoon into an even layer.",
    "Let lightly brown underneath and then rotate in the pan to brown again. This will take a couple of minutes.",
    "Add in the paprika, balsamic vinegar, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, onion granules and garlic powder.",
    "Stir to evenly coat.",
    "Add in the stock and bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium (the stock should still bubble slightly), let the stock bubble and reduce down so it just coats the mushrooms. (this step is important as if you don't reduce it down your sauce will be watery).",
    "Stir in the cream cheese until melted and sauce is creamy and silky.",
    "Taste and season with salt and black pepper.",
    "Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley.",
    "Serve and enjoy!!"
