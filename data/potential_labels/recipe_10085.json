    "To make the butter, simply combine the first five \"cilantro-lime butter\" ingredients together in a bowl and use a spoon to stir/mash until blended. Store in refrigerator if not used immediately.",
    "To prepare fish, combine first four \"fish ingredients\"; sprinkle over both sides of fish and then lightly coat fish with cooking spray. Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish and cook 3 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Place fish on a serving platter and top with a dollop of cilantro-lemon butter. Serve with a lemon wedge, to be squeezed on top of the fish."
