    "Place the flour, sugar and butter into a food processor and process it until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.",
    "Slowly adding the iced water until a smooth dough forms.",
    "Knead the dough into a ball on a lightly floured surface.",
    "Wrap in plastic wrap and place it into the fridge for at least 30 minutes.",
    "When you're ready to use your dough, roll it out on a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin until it is 3mm thick.",
    "If you're making a pie or dessert that has both a pastry bottom and top, it's best to divide your dough into 2 and roll them out separately.",
    "Bake the pastry in an oven preheated to 180 degrees celsius for approximately 20 minutes or until lightly golden and crispy.",
    "Please note that if you're not adding the pie/dessert filling immediately, place a sheet of baking paper over the bottom of the pastry and fill with baking weights or rice (uncooked) before placing into the oven. Remove the weights halfway through the baking time."
