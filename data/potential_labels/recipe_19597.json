    "Instructions",
    "Rinse oxtails with water and vinegar and pat dry. Cover oxtails with brown sugar, soy sauce, Worchestire sauce, salt, garlic powder, black pepper, all-spice, and browning and rub into oxtails.",
    "Set Pressure Cooker on High Saut√© and once hot, add vegetable oil. Next, add your larger oxtail pieces to the pot, flat side down about ¬º inch apart, and brown on each side.",
    "Remove oxtail after browning and place in bowl.",
    "Deglaze your pressure cooker by adding about 2 Tbsp of beef broth to the insert. Take a wooden spoon and deglaze your pot by removing the brown bits at the bottom. Then add your yellow onions, green onions, carrots, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper. Stir and saut√© for about 5 minutes or until the onions have softened.",
    "Add dried thyme, oxtails, remaining beef broth, and ketchup to the pressure cooker insert.",
    "Press ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù on your Instant Pot. Cover and cook on high pressure for 45 minutes. Once timer is done, allow pressure cooker to naturally release.",
    "Once all pressure has released, open lid and remove oxtails and vegetables, leaving liquid behind. Turn Pressure Cooker on saut√©. Once liquid begins to simmer, create a corn starch slurry by combining corn starch and water to a separate bowl. Stir into simmering liquid. Add drained butter beans into pressure cooker and allow to simmer for about 5 minutes, until liquid is slightly thickened and butterbeans are warmed.",
    "Add oxtails and vegetables back to the pressure cooker. Serve and enjoy üôÇ",
    "Slow Cooker Instructions",
    "Prepare recipe as instructed up until the oxtails need to be browned. Brown oxtail over medium-high heat on the stovetop in a skillet. Once oxtail are browned, deglaze skillet by adding 2 Tbsp of beef broth. Add onions and carrots to skillet and stir until onions have softened. Add these ingredients to the slow cooker as well as all remaining ingredients, except the butter beans. Cook on low heat for 8-10 hours or until oxtail is tender. 30 minutes before serving, add drained butter beans to slow cooker.",
    "Stove Top Instructions",
    "Follow the instructions above and then rather than placing in a slow cooker or pressure cooker, cook it on the stove on medium low heat for about 3 hours, stirring occasionaly or until oxtails are tender. Add the butter beans when there is about 30 minutes left on the cook time.",

    "Notes on Pressure Cooker Oxtails",
    "It‚Äôs best if all your oxtails are medium sized oxtails that are similar in size. If you can‚Äôt get them the same size, no worries. It‚Äôll still work.",
    "Oxtail that is too fatty will lead to fatty gravy. You want some fat, just not too much fat. If you‚Äôre oxtail is extremely fatty, use a paring knife to remove some of the excess fat.",
    "Scotch Bonnet is typically used for this recipe. If you can‚Äôt find a scotch bonnet, a habanero can be substituted. You could also use about 1-2 tsp of this scotch bonnet pepper sauce.",

    "Well, I am sure this is the most delicious of Jamaican Recipes. The ingredients look amazing as do the pictures. I wish I could lie and say that I was a beginner cook, but alas I have been cooking for some years! I suppose I am an inconsistent cook, some days amazing, some days totally burnt, some days only a little burnt and other days just on the verge of. This recipe looked amazing! I gather all the ingredients and start my preps. Your recipe calls for 1 TABLESPOON of Salt!? Is this correct? I don‚Äôt have or cannot find a scotch bonnet chili, so I decide I will just use the powdered chilli‚Ä¶not sure how much but just keeping sprinkling till I think that looks about right! I even make my own browning and as I have no idea what browning is‚Ä¶I looked on YouTube and came across an easy browning recipe‚Ä¶really easy‚Ä¶.1/2 cup brown sugar over low heat‚Ä¶now this lovely Jamaican lady keeps emphasizing to keep stirring the sugar so that it does not burn‚Ä¶it will eventually melt turning a gorgeous dark brown color‚Ä¶you then you add water a little bit at a time until you have a lovely brown sauce‚Ä¶I had this on such a low heat, it took me 35 minutes to get it to turn into a sticky liquid..stirring all the time‚Ä¶I am really into this recipe and want to do EVERYTHING correctly (it is my husbands birthday dinner and he has been looking forward to this for 2 days) As this lovely lady pours water into her melted sugar, up comes the steam from her pan‚Ä¶still stirring‚Ä¶more water‚Ä¶still stirring..looks gorgeous‚Ä¶but she does not say to use boiling water‚Ä¶so I add tap water and my sugar mixture‚Ä¶which is looking amazing at this point‚Ä¶turns into a solid block of crystallized sugar‚Ä¶.oh well‚Ä¶no browning used then! I put everything into my slow cooker and leave it for 4 hours before tasting it‚Ä¶.well, I am not sure which was worse the 1 TBS of Salt or the chili that I had added‚Ä¶I tasted a 1/4 tsp of the sauce and it is not so much as taking my head off, as not sure which part of my body it will take off‚Ä¶..at the moment it is sort of working itself‚Ä¶painfully around my stomach, throat, nose‚Ä¶.intestines‚Ä¶very slowly, painfully and gaining momentum‚Ä¶.mhhh‚Ä¶I am not sure which is going to be more painful the chili and salt or telling my husband he is having scrambled eggs for his birthday dinner! I will try this again as it really does sound and look great! Sometimes, this is my Forking Life!",

    "Hi Angie, so sorry to hear it didn‚Äôt work out for you the first time. Here‚Äôs some tips for next time‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt use chili powder, it will give it a whole different flavor profile. If you can find a fresh scotch bonnet pepper, a fresh habanero pepper or even a jalape√±o pepper would work. But not chili powder which can have it‚Äôs own added salt and other spices. The 1 Tablespoon of salt is correct but feel free to cut that in half in the rub and then salt to taste afterwards. If you can‚Äôt find the browning in the store, you can leave it out. Your oxtails will just be lighter but still taste amazing. Thank you for sharing your experience, it happens, please let me know how it turns out next time,",

    "Hello,",
    "Question,",
    "For butter beans, do you cook them before adding? Because it says drained. Or do you mean out of a can?",
    "If I buy dry beans, is it the same process??",
    "Ty!!",
    "REPLY",
    "Tanya says",
    "February 8, 2020 at 4:16 pm",
    "Hi K, I‚Äôve never made this recipe with dried butter beans as I use canned for this recipe. I‚Äôm guessing if you put dried beans in with the ingredients before pressure cooking that it should be ok since it‚Äôs a 45 minute cook time. My only fear is actually overcooking them a little with this method.",

    "These are some of the best oxtails I have ever tasted. Forget paying a fortune at the restaurant, I paid a little over $16 for 2.7 pounds of oxtails and most of the ingredients I already had in my pantry, so comparatively, a $12 large oxtails with rice/peas & cabbage doesn‚Äôt compare. I am about to make your rice/peas (already made by cabbage with carrots & red onions) and if they come out as well as the oxtail, I will be raving about you to everyone I know.",

    "Scotch bonnets and Habaneros are not the same pepper. They‚Äôre cousins but not the same, scotch bonnets look like little hats and habaneros have a more traditional pepper shape. They‚Äôre both great peppers but different levels of heat and flavor profiles.",
