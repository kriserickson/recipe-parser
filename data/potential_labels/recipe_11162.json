    "In a large lidded skillet, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over medium. Stir in 4 cups cherry tomatoes and 1 large eggplant (1 1/4 lbs), cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Cook, covered, 15 minutes. (If skillet does not have a lid, try covering tightly with aluminum foil or a baking sheet.) Stir in 3 cloves sliced garlic and 1/4 tsp salt; cover and cook another 10 to 15 minutes, until tomatoes are slightly wilted. Meanwhile, bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 1 lb whole wheat fusilli as per pkg instructions, reserving 3/4 cup pasta water. Using a slotted spoon, transfer fusilli to skillet with tomato-eggplant mixture. Stir in 1/2 cup pasta water, 3/4 cup torn basil, 3/4 cup shredded ricotta salata, 2 tbsp oil and 1/2 tsp salt. (If dish seems dry, stir in 1/4 cup pasta water.) Garnish with 1/3 cup torn basil and 1/4 cup shredded ricotta salata.",
