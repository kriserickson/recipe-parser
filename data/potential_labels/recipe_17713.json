    "In a bowl, whisk together the salt, paprika, brown sugar, cumin, cayenne and coriander. Rub the mix on the ribs, coating both racks completely. Transfer the racks to 2 large vacuum-seal bags and seal shut. Alternatively, place the ribs in sealable plastic bags and dip them into a large bowl of water to displace the air before sealing shut.",
    "Preheat a pot of water fitted with a sous-vide immersion circulator to 155° according to the manufacturer's directions. Cook the ribs for 24 hours, making sure the bag remains completely submerged.",
    "The next day, remove the ribs from the bags and light a grill. Grill the ribs, flipping often, basting them with the barbecue sauce until lightly charred, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and carve, then serve."
