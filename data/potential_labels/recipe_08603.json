    "Preheat the oven to 425F.",
    "In a roasting pan, toss the cauliflower florets in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and season with pepper. Roast for 25 minutes, tossing occasionally until the cauliflower starts to brown. Remove from the oven, and set aside.",
    "In a wide, shallow pan, fry the onion in the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over high heat for 3–4 minutes. Add the garlic, mushrooms, and ginger, and cook for another minute, stirring.",
    "Stir in the spices, and cook for a minute, then add the coconut milk. Season to taste.",
    "Bring to a boil, then stir in the cauliflower. Reduce the heat, cover the pan, and cook for about 5 minutes on low heat. Serve with plenty of fresh cilantro.",
    "TIP: If you’d like to make this dish fat-free, simply replace the coconut milk with vegetable stock."
