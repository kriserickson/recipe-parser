    "Preheat oven to 375F and lightly grease an individually-sized oven-safe dish. Set aside.",
    "Combine applesauce, almond milk, nut butter, maple syrup, cinnamon, and vanilla extract in a large shallow bowl, mixing until fully combined. Pour bread cubes into the mixture and use a fork to lightly press down so that they absorb most of the liquid. Add oats and apple cubes, and gently stir until everything is evenly incorporated. If the mix seems too dry, add a splash of extra milk.",
    "Transfer mixture to your prepared dish, sprinkling with additional cinnamon and sugar if desired. Bake for 20 minutes, until the bake has set and the top has turned golden brown.",
    "Remove from oven and top with toppings of choice or simply enjoy as is!"
