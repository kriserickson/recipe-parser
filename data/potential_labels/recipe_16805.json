    "In a stainless steel bowl, placed over a saucepan of boiling water, whisk together the egg whites, coconut sugar, and salt. When this mixture is warm to the touch, and nice and creamy, remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract, almond flour, and shredded coconut. Cover and refrigerate for about two hours, or until firm.",
    "Preheat oven to 325°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.",
    "Bunch up small mounds of batter with your fingers and place on the parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing an inch apart. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes or until the edges of the coconut are golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes and then place on a wire rack to cool.",
    "Optional Chocolate Coating: Melt 1-2 large bars of organic dark chocolate in a small sauce pan on very low heat. Dip the bottom of each macaroon into the chocolate and give it a good coating. Set the dipped macaroons on a plate or cookie sheet covered in wax paper. Let cool in the fridge to harden the chocolate.",
    "Makes about 2 dozen macaroons.",
    "Note: You can make these with almond flour, spelt flour, or coconut flour."
