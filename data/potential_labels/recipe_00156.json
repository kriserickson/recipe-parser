    "Remove the ends from the green beans and cut them into 1/2 inch pieces. Wash and drain the beans, place them in a pot, and cover with cold salted water. Bring the beans to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, partially cover the pot, and simmer the beans about 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender. Immediately drain the beans, and cover with cold water to stop further cooking. Allow the beans to sit in the water for a minute, then drain again. When the beans have cooled completely, gently press the beans to squeeze out excess water. Put the beans in a large bowl with the remaining ingredients, and season to taste. Toss gently to mix, cover tightly, and refrigerate several hours or overnight. Prior to serving, taste the salad and adjust the seasoning if desired."
