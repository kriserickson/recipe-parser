    "Add the chorizo, onion and bacon fat to a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook, stirring often, until the onion begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the celery stalks and bell peppers and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and garlic and cook for 1 minute more.",
    "Add all the remaining ingredients and bring the skillet to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, stir the pot one more time and then cover it with a tight fitting lid. Cook for 20 minutes then check to see if the rice is cooked. If there is still liquid in the pan let it cook for another 5 minutes then remove the pot from the heat. Let the pot sit for 5 minutes, covered, before you serve it.",
    "Stir the jambalaya well, remove the bay leaves and sprinkle the top with some green onions.",
    "Enjoy!"
