    "Trim the stems from the Swiss chard. Tear the leaves into bite-size pieces. Reserve half of the stems for another use or discard them. Slice the remaining stems into 2-inch lengths, then into thin matchsticks, and transfer them to a medium bowl.",
    "Stack the cucumber rounds and slice them into matchsticks. Add them to the bowl with the chard stems, along with the carrot and radish slices. Toss with the sugar and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt; let stand as you prepare the rest of the meal.",
    "Meanwhile, pour 1 tablespoon of the canola oil into a large skillet over medium heat. Use tongs to add the Swiss chard leaves in batches, as needed, adding more as each batch cooks down. Add the pinch of salt and cook, stirring frequently with the tongs, until the leaves are wilted and the pan is mostly dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat; use a spatula to push the greens to one side of the pan. Holding the chard in place and gently squeezing, tilt the pan over the sink to pour off any excess liquid. Transfer the chard to a bowl and stir in 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and the sesame seeds. Wipe out the skillet.",
    "Just before serving, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of canola oil and the remaining teaspoon of sesame oil in the skillet over medium heat. Press the rice into the skillet, making a thick cake. Cook, without stirring or shaking, until a golden brown crust forms on the bottom of the rice, 4 to 5 minutes.",
    "Rinse and drain the sliced-vegetable mixture in a colander (wiping out the bowl it was in), then blot it dry with paper towels or a clean dish towel and return it to the bowl. Add the vinegar and toss to incorporate.",
    "Wave the nori squares over the flame of a gas burner a few times, until the corners curl and they turn crisp. (Alternatively, roast them under a broiler for just a few seconds, watching carefully so they don't burn.) Slice into thin strips with a chef's knife, or crumble with your fingers.",
    "To serve, use a spatula to scoop out the rice and divide it among four bowls, ensuring that everyone gets some of the crispy part. Top with the chard greens, kimchi, tofu and the vegetable mixture. Garnish with the nori and serve immediately, passing gochujang at the table."
