    "Directions",
    "Dissolve the yeast in large mixing bowl with warmed milk. Let bubble for a few minutes.",
    "Add sugar, butter, oil, and vanilla to milk/yeast mixture. Stir to combine.",
    "Add egg and combine thoroughly.",
    "Sift together salt, potato starch, cornstarch, millet flour, baking soda, baking powder, and xanthan gum.",
    "Slowly add flour mixture to mixing bowl. Stir until well combined. If the dough appears too sticky/wet, add more flour as necessary.",
    "Remove dough from mixing bowl and place in a greased container and put in a warm place to rise for 45-60 minutes. The dough will be extremely sticky, do not worry, this is normal.",
    "Preheat oven to 400Â°F.",
    "Roll dough to 1/4\" thick 13 x 13 square between 2 pieces of well floured parchment paper. (I used my fingers to flatten the dough most of the way, sprinkled the top with rice flour, laid my parchment down and GENTLY rolled the rolling pin a few times over the top. I find this way, there is less likely of a chance that the dough will stick to your parchment paper.)",
    "Remove top sheet of paper from rolled dough and spread softened butter on top of dough.",
    "Combine brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over buttered dough surface. Leave a 2\" strip of dough uncovered at one end of square. Some reviewers have commented that there is too much filling, if so, don't use it all ;).",
    "Using bottom sheet of parchment paper has an aid, roll the dough into a log. Start at the end opposite of that which you left uncovered.",
    "Carefully cut into 8 equal pieces using a serrated knife. ( I used a piece of thread and it worked like a charm..this would be my recommendation.) Place rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving about half an inch between rolls to allow for expansion. Put any remaining cinnamon/sugar mixture in the bottom of the dish.",
    "At this point you can either bake them or allow them to rise a bit longer. (In the picture you see above, I did not let them rise more...they went right into the oven.)",
    "Bake in oven for ~18-22 minutes until tops are golden brown and delicious. Check for doneness by running a knife between rolls in the center of the dish. Dough should not easily stick to the knife.",
    "While the rolls are baking, whip together frosting ingredients until soft and creamy. Try not to eat it all before the rolls are done!"
