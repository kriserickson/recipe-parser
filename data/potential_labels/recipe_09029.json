    "Instructions:",
    "In a blender or food processor, mix the eggs, yolks, mustard, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Melt your coconut oil over a very low heat, just to let it turn from a solid to a liquid. You do not want it hot, or it will “cook” the eggs.",
    "Now, you’re going to need to slowly pour in your oils while your food processor/blender is running at a low speed. You need to do this very slowly, just pouring a very thin stream—pouring through the two little holes in the lid of your food processor help to accomplish this. Once all the oils are emulsified, add in your yogurt and/or whey if you’d like. The yogurt gives it a semi-sweet and tangy flavor and can help it stay fresh, but the whey is what will really help the mayo keep longer (about a month, versus a week or so). Refrigerate and enjoy!"
