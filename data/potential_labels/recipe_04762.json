    "Prep all vegetables as directed in ingredients and place in large bowl. Add salt and chilli flakes. Use a larger bowl than you think you might need, as it lends to better veggie massaging.",
    "Massage cabbage mix for about 10 minutes and then set aside. While resting, the salt will help the veggies to 'sweat', releasing some of their water.",
    "Return to massage for another 10 minutes, until cabbage and other veggies are softened and a few tablespoons worth of water has been released.",
    "Divide the mix between two 1 gallon/1 litre mason jars.",
    "Press kimchi mix down, helping get out any air bubbles and ideally have some of the liquid come to the top.",
    "Seal jar loosely and place in a warm spot (like on top or or beside your fridge). Let sit for 4-5 days. If foam starts to form, you can skim that off. After about 4 days, taste the kimchi (with a clean fork, never double dip) and decide if you want to let it ferment longer or you're ready to enjoy it.",
    "Once ready, seal the jar and store in your fridge. Will keep for 2-3 months sealed."
