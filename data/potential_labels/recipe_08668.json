    "Coarsely chop chiles in a food processor. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in tequila. Let sit uncovered 1–3 hours (chiles will get less spicy as they soak; in 1 hour, they’ll sink to the heat level of a jalapeño). Drain chiles; reserve tequila for another use.",
    "Transfer chiles to a small saucepan; add onion, vinegar, orange juice, raw sugar, salt, and 1 cup water and bring to a boil over medium-low heat. Cook until chiles are tender and liquid is syrupy, 50–60 minutes. Let cool.",
    "Do Ahead: Jam can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill."
