    "Use a small, sharp knife to top and tail the oranges. Cut down the sides of each orange, following its natural curves, to take off the skin and pith. Holding the orange over a large bowl (to catch the juice), cut in between the membranes to remove the individual segments, discarding the membrane and pips as you go; break up the segments slightly as you add them to the bowl. Add the lemon juice, oil and a teaspoon of salt, and toss to combine. You can make the salad in advance up to this stage, but donâ€™t add the remaining ingredients until just before you want to eat. Once everything is in the bowl, toss again gently, transfer to a large platter or individual plates, and serve at once."
