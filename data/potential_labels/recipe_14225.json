    "Mix the flour with water and knead it for about 15 minutes or until the dough gets soft. Separate the dough into two equal portions and roll them into cylinders (about 1 inch in diameter). Cover them with wet towel and set aside.",
    "Prepare the chives by chopping off the root or white part of the chives. Use only the green part. Mix the chives with the ground pork and add all the ingredients in Filling. Stir to combine well.",
    "To prepare the wrapper, cut the dough into 1/4 inch length and use a rolling pin to flatten it until it becomes a round shape about 3 inches in diameter. Put a small spoonful of filling into the center of the skin and seal it up tightly with your fingers. (No pleating is needed for this recipe). Repeat the same until you use up all the ingredients.",
    "Bring a pot of water to boil. Drop the dumplings into the boiling water and cover the pot. As soon as the dumplings start to float (meaning they are cooked), dish them out using a strainer onto a serving platter. Serve hot with black vinegar."
