    "Slide the rösti onto a clean plate. Drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, then invert into the pan so the crispy side is up. Cook until crispy on the other side, 8 to 10 minutes more. Slide onto a serving plate and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cut into 6 wedges."
