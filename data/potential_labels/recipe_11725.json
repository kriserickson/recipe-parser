    "Steam the cauliflower until very soft then pur√©e in a food processor. Transfer the mash into a medium saucepan and add the butter and milk to taste. Season with salt and pepper, then cover and keep warm over low heat until needed.",
    "Place the spinach and 1/4 cup of water in a large pot, and cook over medium-high until the leaves wilt, about 3-4 minutes. Drain the spinach in a colander then put back into the pot with some butter to taste. Cover and keep warm over low heat.",
    "Pat the scallops dry and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until the foam subsides, then sear the scallops, turning once, until they are nicely caramelized and cooked to your desired doneness, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter and keep warm until all of the scallops have been cooked.",
    "To serve, spoon some cauliflower mash into the middle of each plate, top with a nest of spinach then top with the seared scallops. Garnish with a crown of microgreens, some lemon zest and a light drizzle of good quality olive oil."
