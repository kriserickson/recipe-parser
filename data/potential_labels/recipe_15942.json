    "Make sure your natural style peanut butter is thoroughly mixed before measuring (you donâ€™t want to get all oil or all solids). In a blender or food processor combine all of the ingredients except the sriracha sauce. Begin with only 1/4 cup of water and add more until you get the consistency you want (I used 1/2 cup total). Add the sriracha sauce a little at a time (blending between) until it is to your desired heat (I used about 1/2 tsp).",
    "Enjoy the peanut sauce on salads, pasta or as a dipping sauce!"
