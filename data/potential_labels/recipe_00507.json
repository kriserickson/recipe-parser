    "Heat a large pan over medium-low heat. Add a little oil. Sauté the pears for about 2-3 minutes per side, until they’re a little soft, a little brown at the edges, but still holding their shape. Set aside. Repeat with the plums or pluots.",
    "While the fruit cooks, toast the nuts in a dry skillet over medium-low heat, stirring often to keep from burning, about 3-5 minutes.",
    "Make the vinaigrette by whisking together the olive oil, vinegar and garlic until emulsified. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
    "Toss the arugula with the dressing. Top the greens with the seeds and the fruit. Season to taste. Serve immediately."
