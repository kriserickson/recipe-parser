    "Heat a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the olive oil and ground beef and break the meat apart with a wooden spoon. Cook until browned and mostly cooked through, about five minutes.",
    "Add the onion, bell peppers and garlic and sauté until tender, about five more minutes.",
    "Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, beef broth, basil, oregano, salt and pepper and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.",
    "While the soup is simmering, cook the rice according to the package directions. (I used 1 cup long grain white rice, 2 cups water and 1 tsp kosher salt, brought to a boil in a medium saucepan then turn heat to low and cook covered for 20 minutes, until the rice is tender and there’s no water left in the pan.)",
    "Stir the parsley into the soup. To serve, ladle soup then divide the rice among each serving bowl. Serves 4-6 as a main dish",
    "*It’s really good if you add some crushed red pepper flakes too.",
    "*If you’re wondering why you can’t just cook the rice directly in the soup instead of dirtying another pot, I wouldn’t recommend it unless the soup will be eaten immediately. Rice (and pasta too!) will keep absorbing liquid if given the opportunity, so leftovers would be mushy and too thick. Since I was just making this for 2, I packed the leftover soup and rice in different containers and reheated them separately the next day."
