    "Preheat oven to 350-degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together first 8 ingredients until smooth. Add the beef, turkey and bread crumbs, combining well. Shape into 4 individual, football-shaped mounds, each about 2-inches high. Place on a baking sheet with a lip that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Spread ketchup/honey mixture evenly over the entire tops of each meatloaf.",
    "Place the prepared vegetables in a separate pan, cut side down. Spray the top of the cut vegetables with cooking spray. Bake meatloaf and vegetables 20-25 minutes, or until no longer pink in the middle(160-degrees F) and the peppers and onions have blackened. You may need to remove meatloat first and allow the peppers and onions to continue cooking an additional 5-7 minutes. Remove, divide the meatloaf onto serving plates and evenly divide vegetables."
