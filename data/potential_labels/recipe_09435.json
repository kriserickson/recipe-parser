    "Melt butter in a warmed 10-inch cast-iron skillet and swirl to allow butter to coat all sides. Place empty pan in oven to heat for 5 minutes, then add cornbread batter to hot pan, spreading evenly.",
    "Bake until a toothpick inserted in center of cornbread comes out clean and top is golden brown (about 20 minutes).",
    "Remove pan from oven and run a blunt knife around edges. Remove cornbread from pan and let cool on wire rack. Break up cornbread into good sized chunks for stuffing and leave on countertop for 1 hour to crisp up. The cornbread can be baked the day before.",

    "Transfer stuffing to a foil-lined greased baking dish or loaf pan (makes about 2 loaves) or use to fill a 20 lb turkey. If stuffing turkey, stuff just before putting the turkey in the oven and wait for stuffing to cool in refrigerator for 1 hour before using. Fill turkey about 3/4 full with the stuffing. About 3/4 pound of stuffing per pound of turkey will be sufficient. A stuffed bird will take slightly longer to roast (see the roasting chart on Cooks.com)."
