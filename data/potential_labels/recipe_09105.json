    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Combine cabbage, apple, vinegar, and 2 tablespoons of oil in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Toss to combine, then let soften, tossing occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, cook pork chops. In a large skillet, heat remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with fennel seeds and salt and pepper. Cook, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 140 degrees F, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Let rest 5 minutes, then serve over the slaw and garnish with additional parsley."
