    "Place butter in a medium sized pot over low medium/low heat. Stir until butter is slightly melted then add sugar. Once butter is melted, bring to a boil over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until it thickens. Stir constantly. You want the butter and sugar to be combined and a caramel color.",
    "After 3 minutes, remove pan from heat and pour evenly over saltine crackers. Spread mixture with a knife... however it doesn't have to be perfect.",
    "Place pan in oven and bake for 6-8 minutes or until lightly golden brown. Do not over bake. The mixture will spread evenly over the crackers as it bakes.",
    "Remove pan from oven and then take foil off of the pan. Allow the toffee to cool and then break pieces off of foil."
