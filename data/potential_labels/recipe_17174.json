    "Add onion and garlic, cook for 2 minutes until translucent.",
    "Add flour and cook for 1 minute.",
    "Switch to a whisk and add half the milk. Whisk to dissolve the pasty onion mixture into the milk (about 20 seconds). Then add remaining milk, chicken broth, risoni and peas.",
    "Bring to simmer then turn heat down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 5 minutes - stir occasionally for the first half then more frequently during the second half.",
    "At 5 minutes, take it off the stove - it will still be quite saucy (see video) but will reduce in the next steps and while serving.",
    "Stir through parmesan cheese, salt and pepper to taste. Then gently stir through salmon.",
    "Serve immediately, sprinkled with parsley leaves if desired."
