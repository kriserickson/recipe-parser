    "Step 1",
    "Grease the sides of a round 9-inch springform pan that is 3 inches deep with cooking spray or softened butter. Line the sides with a strip of parchment.",
    "Step 2",
    "Add the cream cheese to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium speed, about 3 minutes, until smooth. Add the heavy cream, increase the speed to medium-high and continue to whisk until incorporated.",
    "Step 3",
    "Add the sugar and vanilla, and whisk the mixture, about 3 to 5 minutes, until it holds stiff peaks that stand upright when the whisk is raised. Use a rubber spatula to fold in the rainbow sprinkles and mix just to incorporate.",
    "Step 4",
    "Spread a thin layer of whipped cream (about 1 3/4 cups) on the bottom of the pan and cover with a layer of cookies, filling any gaps with broken cookies (breaking them yourself, if necessary.) The pieces should touch; the goal is a solid layer of cookies. Continue layering until you reach the top of the pan, ending with a layer of cream.",
    "Cover the top of the cake with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours, or overnight.",
    "Step 5",
    "To serve, remove the sides of the pan and peel away the parchment strip. Place on a serving plate and lightly press sprinkles onto the top and sides of the cake, if desired. Slice as you would a layer cake and serve."
