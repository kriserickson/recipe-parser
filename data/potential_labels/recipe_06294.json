    "Roasted Poblano Pepper & Green Tomato Chili",
    "2 poblano peppers",
    "2 Anaheim peppers, chopped",
    "4 cloves garlic, chopped",
    "2 onions, chopped",
    "1 1/2 lb boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces",
    "1 1/2 lb green (unripe) tomatoes*, chopped",
    "15 ounce can hominy",
    "12 oz chicken broth",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "2 tablespoons PLUS 1 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper",
    "1 tablespoon smoked paprika",
    "1 tablespoon red pepper flakes",
    "1 teaspoon cumin",
    "juice of 1/2 lime",
    "Place the cubed chicken in a resealable bag. Sprinkle with lime juice, cumin and 1 teaspoon ground chipotle. Marinate 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place the poblano chiles in a heat safe dish and broil 5 minutes on each side. Remove to a towel and allow to cool, five minutes. Gently use a towel to remove the skins from the chiles, using a circular motion. Cut a slit down one side of each chile (or in the middle, if a split formed while removing the skin) and remove the seeds with as spoon. Discard the seeds. Cut up the chiles into 1/2 inch pieces. Saute the onion, red pepper flakes and garlic in olive oil until the onion is just translucent. Add the chicken, remaining spices and Anaheim chile and saute until the chicken is almost cooked through. The chicken should look white on all sides, but night still be slightly raw in the center. Stir in the poblano chiles, hominy and chicken broth. Cook covered for about 15 minutes, then remove lid and cook 15 additional minutes or until mixture thickens slightly.",
    "*Some unripe tomatoes will be green on the outside and slightly pink on the inside. This doesn't make much difference to the dish."
