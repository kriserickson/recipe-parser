    "Make the dough first by stirring together flour, baking powder, sea salt and herbs. Then create a well in the centre of the mixture and pour oil and warm water in. Then fold together with a spatula until well combined and sticky. It will be wet and sticky but it should form a mound or ball. Let it rest in the bowl covered with a tea towel while you prepare the soup.",
    "Heat a stock pot over medium heat and saut√© onion, carrot, and celery in vegetable oil for 4 to 5 minutes. Then add minced garlic, thyme, sage, dill, and ground pepper and stir together for another 2 minutes.",
    "Then stir in potatoes for 2 minutes. Then add stock and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes until fork tender and soft for about 8 to 10 minutes.",
    "Once boiling you'll dollop small spoonfuls of dough into the soup. They will float to the surface and puff up. They cook for about 8 to 10 minutes. In the last 2 minutes of the dumplings cooking add peas, kale, and parsley. Serve immediately!"
