    "1. Preheat oven to 300 F. Grease two 6-inch round cake pans** and line bottoms with parchment paper. Add all dry ingredients (flours through poppyseeds) to a large bowl and whisk to combine.",
    "2. In a medium bowl, combine your vinegar, applesauce and coconut oil. Whisk to mix well.",
    "3. Add wet ingredients to dry and stir everything till combined (Batter will be a little thick).",
    "4. Divide batter into two prepared cake pans. Bake for about 19-21 minutes. Let cool completely and remove from pans.",
    "To assemble cake, spread cream cheese frosting (reciep below) over layer of cake and top with remaining layer. Serve cake pieces with a drizzle of raspberry-beet coulis and enjoy! Drizzle coulis when serving so the cake doesn’t get soggy. Refrigerate leftover cake (if there’s any left!).",
    "*The recipe calls for Mila – this stuff is amazing! If you have followed my blog for a while, you know that I love chia! Mila is super charged ground chia seeds in a proprietary blend. I will be posting on the wonders of Mila soon :)",
    "**You can make cupcakes if preferred, line or grease 8 muffin tins and bake for 18-20 minutes."
