    "Set the oven at 375 F. Spread peanuts evenly onto a cookie sheet. Pictured are the nuts before going into the oven.",
    "Roast for 5 to 15 minutes depending on how dark you want them. I roasted mine for about 10 minutes total. When you pull them out of the oven they will be shiny with oil and golden like the ones pictured here. Let them sit on the tray until they are cool to the touch.",
    "Dump the peanuts into a food processor or blender and add the salt. Grind it! For the first 30 seconds it will be extremely loud. Don't worry, it will quiet down.",
    "Grind for another couple of minutes. It should start to look a little sticky and gummy as the oils release. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of your food processor occasionally just to make sure that every bit is incorporated into the final peanut butter.",
    "Keep grinding and will start to become a recognizable, chunky peanut butter. But keep going, it will get smoother and looser.",
    "Grind until it reaches a consistency you like. I would suggest that if you like a chunky peanut butter to keep some peanuts aside at the beginning and then break them up a bit with a knife and simply stir them into your creamy peanut butter. Scoop into a jar and enjoy!"
