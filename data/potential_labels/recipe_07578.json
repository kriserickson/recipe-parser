    "Place the potatoes on a aluminum foil-lined baking pan. Get as much of the apple filling between the slices of potato as possible, and use the remainder as a topping.",
    "Bake covered with aluminum foil for about 40 minutes, and uncover for an additional 15 minutes to crisp up the topping."
