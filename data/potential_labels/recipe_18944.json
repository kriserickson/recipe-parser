    "MAKE THE TEHINA SAUCE: Nick off a piece of the garlic (about a quarter of the clove) and drop it into a food processor.",
    "Squeeze the lemon juice into the food processor. Pour the tehina on top, making sure to scrape it all out of the container, and add the salt and cumin.",
    "Process until the mixture looks peanut-buttery, about 1 minute.",
    "Stream in the ice water, a little at a time, with the motor running. Process just until the mixture is smooth and creamy and lightens to the color of dry sand (it will look ugly and clumpy before it smooths out). Now you have Quick Tehina Sauce!",
    "MAKE THE HUMMUS: Add the chickpeas to the tehina sauce and process for about 3 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl as you go, until the chickpeas are completely blended and the hummus is smooth and uniform in color.",
    "To hold or store any leftovers: press plastic wrap onto the surface of the hummus to keep it from forming a skin. Refrigerate any leftovers and return to room temperature to serve. (The food processor is your friend here! Whir it in there to speed up the warming.)"
