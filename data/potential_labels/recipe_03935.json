    "Preheat a griddle pan on a medium-high heat. Season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper, and cook it for about three minutes on each side for medium rare. Remove the steak, let it rest for a few minutes, and then slice it diagonally across the grain into thin strips. The grain? We mean the tough muscle fibres running through meat. Cutting through these results in more tender pieces of meat.",
    "Chop the tomatoes and mix them together in a bowl with the onion and half a teaspoon of the pre-crushed garlic. Add the meat and lettuce, pour on the vinegar and olive oil, and toss well to completely coat everything. Top with crumbled blue cheese to finish. Salads rarely come more inviting than this."
