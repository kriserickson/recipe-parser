    "Place the rice, coconut milk, garlic, salt and 1.5 cups of water in a heavy bottomed pot (I used a 2 qt sized pot for this recipe).",
    "STEP 2: Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat with a lid on the pot.",
    "STEP 3: Once the mixture comes to a boil, immediately turn to “low” heat and continue to cook with the lid on until all of the liquid has absorbed (about 30-40 minutes). Do not lift the lid or you risk losing valuable moisture. If you need to check to see if the liquid has absorbed, only check toward the end of the cooking time. Using a pot with a glass lid helps reduce the need for lifting the lid.",
    "STEP 4: Fluff the rice with a fork and serve!"
