    "HOW TO MAKE IT",
    "In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add carrots, onion, celery and potato and sauté until the onion is translucent, 2-3 minutes. Add white wine, water, cream, thyme, bay leaf and all but a handful of shrimp. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer gently for 20 minutes.",
    "In small batches, puree in a blender or food processor. Return soup to the pan and season with salt, pepper, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Cut the remaining shrimp into small chunks and add to the soup. Simmer gently until cooked through, 2-3 minutes. Garnish with parsley or Queso Fresco."
