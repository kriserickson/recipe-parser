    "Whisk egg whites in a bowl to stiff peaks. Whisk in confectioners' sugar to make glaze; pour off 2⁄3 cup and reserve. Add cinnamon and kirsch to remaining glaze; set aside. Finely grind almonds in a food processor; add granulated sugar and finely grind. Transfer to bowl with spiced glaze; mix into dough.",
    "Transfer dough to a surface sprinkled heavily with sugar; cover with parchment paper. Roll dough until 1⁄4\" thick. Uncover and spread reserved glaze over dough; let sit until glaze sets, about 30 minutes.",
    "Place rum in a bowl, and using a 1 3⁄4\" star cutter, dip cutter in rum and cut out a cookie; repeat and transfer to parchment paper-lined baking sheets, spaced 2\" apart. Let dry for 3 hours. Heat oven to 450°. Bake cookies until glaze just sets but does not brown, 3–4 minutes."
