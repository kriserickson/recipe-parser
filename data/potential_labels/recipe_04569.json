    "In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and sweat them out for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for about 1 minute. Add the crushed tomatoes to the saucepan. Add the whole or diced tomatoes. If you are using whole tomatoes, gently crush them with a potato masher.",
    "Add the salt, pepper, basil, oregano and parsley to the sauce. Stir and let cook. When the sauce starts to bubble, lower the heat to medium-low and cover the pan. Let cook for at least 20 minutes. Taste and adjust for seasonings.",

    "Prepare the marinara sauce. In a small mug, combine the flaxseed and warm water. Mix and let sit for about 10 minutes. This is your binder.",
    "Break up the tempeh and add it to a food processor. Add the shallots, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and the parmesan or nutritional yeast to the food processor. Process until everything is combined.",
    "Add the herbs and the salt to the food processor. Add the flax mixture and 1/3 cup of bread crumbs to the food processor and process until well combined.",
    "Spread the remaining ¼ cup of bread crumbs on a plate. Using a spoon, scoop up some of the tempeh mix and roll it into a ball – about the size of a golf ball. Roll the tempeh meatball in the bread crumbs so that it’s completely covered and set it aside on a plate. Continue making meatballs until you use up all the tempeh mix.",
    "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tempeh meatballs to the skillet and fry them. Depending on the size of your skillet, you may need to fry them in batches. Make sure the meatballs brown on all sides. The way I do this is to pull the skillet back and forth by the handle which makes the tempeh meatballs roll around. I find this covers all the sides better than trying to turn them with a utensil. When they are browned, transfer the meatballs to a paper towel-lined plate.",
    "Gently add the tempeh meatballs to the simmering marinara sauce. Let them cook about 10 minutes until they are heated through. Serve with pasta or in a sandwich."
