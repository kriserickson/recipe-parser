    "Boil or bake some potatoes until they’re done, then remove the pulp inside until they resemble small ’boats’ with walls. Cut off and keep a hold of one part of each potato’s outer layer — you’ll need it later to ’cover’ the potatoes when they’re finished.",
    "Boil the mushrooms until cooked, strain off the water and then chop them up. Add them to a pan and fry together with the onion.",
    "Pour in 1 tablespoon of flour and stir, then pour in 1/2 glass of soup, allow it to simmer, and add the sour cream and salt. Stir, then heat up and fill the potato ’boats’ with this mixture.",
    "Place the stuffed potatoes on a baking tray, cover over the top of each with the piece of outer layer you cut off, and bake. Before baking you can pour over some sour cream and butter, and sprinkle with rusk flour according to taste."
