    "Butterfly the chicken breasts by slicing them in half. Season on both sides with salt and rub with oil.",
    "Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side or until cooked through and no longer pink inside. Remove from heat and transfer chicken to a plate to rest for at least 5 minutes. Cut into strips or bite-sized pieces, then toss chicken with your desired amount of wing sauce.",
    "Meanwhile, toss together lettuce, spring onions and avocado in a large salad bowl. Top with the buffalo chicken and drizzle the dressing all over the top. Serve any extra dressing on the side.",
    "Make The Dressing:",
    "Put all ingredients in a blender and blitz until smooth. Stir in a little extra buttermilk if needed to thin."
