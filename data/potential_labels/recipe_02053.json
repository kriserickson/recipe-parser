    "Add pork ribs, sauté and continue to cook until lightly brown. Pour in the seasonings, mix well.",
    "Transfer all ingredients to a clay pot or a medium pot. Add coca-cola and water. Cover and bring it to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.",
    "Add carrots, simmer for another 20 minutes until sauce thickens. If the sauce is left too much and not thick enough, then swift to higher heat. As the sauce gets lesser and thickens, it’s much more tasteful. Remember to taste by yourself while cooking in this step. If you’re satisfied, it’s done."
