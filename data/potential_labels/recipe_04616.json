    "Stir in the onion, zucchini and rosemary last. The mixture should be thick and clumpy but easy to spoon into a tin. I used an 8” silicone cake tin, but you could also use a metal one with removable bottom. This would work in a pie dish but I’m not sure how well it would remove from the pan.",
    "Press the mixture firmly into the pan but leave the top quite rough for some nice texture.",
    "Bake at 350 degrees F for approx. 30 mins until the top is nice and golden.",
    "Serve either hot or cold."
