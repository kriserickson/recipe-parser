    "In a large cast iron skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Salt and pepper both sides of the chicken then add them to the pan. Cook chicken until done, about 5 minutes on each side. Remove from pan, cover and set aside.",
    "Add the butter to the pan along with the onion and garlic, and saute for about 2 minutes. Add the sun dried tomatoes, and stir well. Add the flour, and with a whisk stir everything together to for about 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock & wine, whisking constantly until smooth. Add cream and continue to whisk for a couple minutes, or until the sauce begins to thicken. Add the basil & stir to combine, then add the chicken back to the pan. Spoon sauce over chicken, and let it set for a couple of minutes to warm through before serving.",
    "This can be served over pasta, but for us we just had a side salad with it. Enjoy!"
