    "Cut chicken fillets into long strips and soak in milk for 1 hour. Drain the chicken, reserving the milk. Whisk reserved milk, eggs and lemon juice together. Combine flour with spices and salt. Dip chicken pieces in seasoned flour, dip in egg mixture and re-coat with flour. Heat the oil in a wok or large saucepan and deep fry chicken until golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper. To achieve an extra crispy crust, quickly deep fry again before serving, if desired. Serve with Green Peppercorn Mayonnaise.",
