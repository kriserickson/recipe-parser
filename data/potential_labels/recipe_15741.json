    "Inside crockpot layer carrots, potatoes, cabbage with the kielbasa pieces on top. Pour either 1 1/2 Celsius water or chicken broth over the top. Cook on low for 8 hours. I've found that there is so much flavor in the kielbasa alone that I don't even need to use the chicken broth for flavor. The small amount of liquid makes everything perfectly moist, leaving an EASY, HEALTHY dinner for your family!",
