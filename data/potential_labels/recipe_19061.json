    "Preheat the oven to 350F. Spread the pecans out on a baking sheet and toast for 7-10 minutes, just until fragrant. Allow to cool, then chop finely in a food processor. Remove and set aside. Clean food processor.",
    "Cut the cream cheese into cubes and toss into the food processor bowl. Process until smooth.",
    "Add the blue cheese and the cranberries and pulse just until the cranberries are slightly chopped. If you process it too long the cheese mixture will take on an unappetizing blue tinge.",
    "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Dampen your fingers and roll balls of the cheese mixture about 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter. They should be small enough for a single bite. Roll in the chopped pecans and place on the parchment paper. Chill in the refrigerator for about 2 hours.",
    "Just before serving, insert a pretzel stick in the middle of each ball. If you insert it too early, it will turn soggy."
