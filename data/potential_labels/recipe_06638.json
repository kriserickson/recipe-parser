    "For the sauce, in a large saucepan set over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until soft and starting to brown, 3-5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juices, breaking them up with the back of a wooden spoon, and bring to a boil, stirring often. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the sauce has thickened, 15-20 minutes. Stir in the basil and season with salt and pepper.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the milk, egg, cheese, breadcrumbs, oregano, salt and pepper. Add the ground chicken and mix gently to avoid overworking the meat. Shape into small, golf ball-sized meatballs â€“ You should have 18 to 24 meatballs.",
    "Transfer the tomato sauce to a slow cooker and add the meatballs to the sauce. Gently toss to coat before covering. Cook on high for 2 hours or until the meatballs have cooked through.",
    "For the sandwiches, put the rolls on baking sheet, cut side up. Put 3 to 4 meatballs on each roll, spoon some of the sauce over the meatballs, and top with the cheeses."
