    "I am a huge fan of cauliflower. I know some people who think cauliflower should be banned from cruditè platters, but I actually love it raw. You can always count on me to finish off those crunchy white florets of goodness. Of course, if I happen to have a ziplock bag on hand, you might find me scooping up those pre-cut florets to bring home for roasting. You see, if you have a bit of time, roasting cauliflower is a guaranteed road to deliciousness.",
    "Simple roasted cauliflower is delicious but if you’re looking for something with a bit more of a kick, this sriracha roasted cauliflower is perfect. It’s spicy, savoury and reminds me a bit like meat. Kind of like a meatless buffalo wing type thing.",
    "On a side note: cauliflower is incredibly expensive here in Tokyo. I’m pretty sure it has to do with their obsession with eating seasonally and locally. Even though cauliflower is a cool-weather crop, as far as I know, it’s not used in Japanese cuisine so they don’t really have any reason to have an abundance of it. Which means it’s on the pricier side. I’m not complaining — I’m not exactly fiending for cauliflower. That being said, when I head back home, I’m definitely going to be roasting a few heads to feed to remind me of the deliciousness that is the oven baked candy of the vegetable world.",
