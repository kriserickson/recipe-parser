    "If making the rice yourself, place a few florets at a time in a food processor and pulse until the cauliflower is small and has the texture of rice or couscous – don’t over process or it will get mushy. Set aside and repeat with the remaining cauliflower in a few batches.",
    "In a large pot, add about 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Add the crab leg and cook, covered until heated through, about 10 minutes. When cooked, remove the crab from the shell and lightly flake.",
    "Season eggs with salt. Heat a large saute pan or wok over medium heat and spray with oil. Add the eggs and cook, turning a few times until set; set aside.",
    "Reduce heat to medium-low, add the sesame oil and saute onions, scallion whites, and garlic about 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft. Raise the heat to medium-high.",
    "Add the cauliflower “rice” to the saute pan along with soy sauce. Mix, cover and cook approximately 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower is slightly crispy on the outside but tender on the inside.",
    "Add the egg and crab, remove from heat and mix in scallion greens."
