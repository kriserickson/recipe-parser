    "Beat the eggs and add the vanilla. Combine the dry ingredients and slowly mix in the eggs until you have a thin batter. Make sure you mix it well to get get rid of any lumps. Heat a non-stick pan with the coconut oil to medium/high heat.",
    "When the pan is ready, pour the batter into the pan and turn down the heat to medium. Allow to cook through (you’ll start to see bubbles appearing on the surface of the batter). Flip over and allow the other side to cook for 1 minute.",
    "Turn onto a plate and top with your preferred toppings.",
    "Note: There is no sugar/honey/banana in the batter so feel free to add this at your discretion."
