    "To prepare the vinaigrette, mix together the shallots, sherry vinegar, pomegranate molasses (or balsamic + honey substitution), and mustard. Slowly whisk in the olive oil until dressing comes together. I like to save bell jars or jars from jam or jelly to use for dressings. Instead of whisking in the olive, I put all of the ingredients into the jar, secure the top very tightly, and shake vigorously until the dressing comes together.",
    "For the salad, mix lettuces in a large bowl. Add pears and half of the crumbled goat cheese (Tip: It is easier to crumble the goat cheese if it is cold). Pour dressing over lettuce but save two tablespoons of dressing. Remember, you can always add, but you canâ€™t take away. Using your heads or salad tongs, toss until dressing lightly coats salad. Add more dressing if salad looks dry.",
    "Crumble the remaining goat cheese over salad. Top with pine nuts (or pistachios) and pomegranate seeds. Serve immediately and enjoy!"
