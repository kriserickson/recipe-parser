    "Mix soy sauce, sesame oil and extra-virgin olive oil together in a bowl. Add sliced mushrooms and toss with the marinade to coat the mushrooms well. Set aside to marinate for 15-20 minutes while you prepare the quinoa salad and dressings.",
    "Peel and shred or coarsely grate the carrot; peel and coarsely grate the beetroot or cut into thin matchsticks; cut cherry tomatoes in half; chop dates and chop almonds.",
    "Mix all salad dressing ingredients together and set aside. Whisk all nut butter dressing ingredients together until smooth and set aside (you may need to add 1-2 teaspoons more water to get a dressing consistency).",
    "Cut avocado in half and remove the stone. Thinly slice the baby radish.",
    "Toss kale/cavolo nero and sesame seeds with marinated mushrooms. Toss cooked quinoa with carrot, beetroot, cherry tomatoes, dates, almonds, parsley, mint and dressing.",
    "To serve, divide marinated mushroom and kale salad, and quinoa salad between plates. Place an avocado half, slices of radish and a small handful of alfalfa sprouts on each plate. Spoon some nut butter dressing over the avocado and scatter with pumpkin seeds. Serve with a wedge of lemon to squeeze over just before eating."
