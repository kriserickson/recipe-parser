    "Combine all the chimichurri ingredients in a small food processor and blend until smooth. (Alternatively, you can finely chop the garlic, shallot and herbs by hand. Mix with the remaining ingredients in a small bowl.) Let sit at room temperature for at least 20 minutes, or cover and refrigerate up to 1 day.",
    "Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly season the fish with a little salt. Rub all sides of each piece of fish with about 1 tablespoon of the chimichurri and place in a baking dish. Reserve the remaining sauce for serving.",
    "Bake for 12-20 minutes — depending on the thickness of the fish — or until fish is firm and almost opaque all the way through. Serve with a little of the reserved chimichurri sauce spooned over each piece."
