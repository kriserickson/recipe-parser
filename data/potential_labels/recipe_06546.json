    "Preheat oven to 180C and spray a baking tray.",
    "Blend down the GF oats to a flour.",
    "Mix your vegan egg powder with recommended water ratio and set aside to gel.",
    "Add your vinegar to non-dairy milk to curdle.",
    "Transfer oat flour to a large bowl, add other flours, baking powder and soda, spices and sugar.",
    "In the blender, mix the curdled milk, vegan “eggs”, purée, and vanilla until smooth.",
    "Pour into flour bowl and mix with wooden spoon until well combined and dough-like. Add in raisins and seeds and mix.",
    "Spoon into the baking pan and flatten dough, cutting your 34+ rusks in rectangular shape OR, using dusted hands, roll into palm-sized rectangles (as I did).",
    "Bake for 45 minutes.",
    "Let cool completely, then bake on 100C for 4 hours on the sides, turning halfway, then leave overnight in the oven to dehydrate.",
    "Dunk into hot drinks or chew as hard biscuits.",
    "These can be stored in an air-tight container for two weeks or so."
