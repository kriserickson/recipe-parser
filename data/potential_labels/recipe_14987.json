    "1 Toast the pine nuts: Heat a small skilled on medium high heat. Spread the pine nuts in an even layer on the bottom of the pan, cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Then remove to a bowl to allow to cool.",
    "Hint when toasting nuts: do not take your eyes off of them! Nuts can go from browned to burned very quickly.",
    "2 Prep the kale: Use a sharp knife to cut out the tough midrib of each kale leaf, and discard or compost. Slice the leaves crosswise into thin, 1/4 inch wide, slices.",
    "The easiest way to do this is to work with a small bunch of leaves at a time, stack the leaves and roll them into a loose cigar shape. Then using a sharp knife, work from one end of the \"cigar\" to the other, slicing a 1/4 inch off from the end.",
    "Place the kale slices into a large bowl.",
    "3 Make the dressing: In a smaller bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, rice vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper.",
    "4 Dress the kale and toss with nuts and cranberries: A half hour to an hour before serving, toss the kale together with the toasted pine nuts, the dried cranberries, and the dressing, allowing the kale to marinate a bit.",
    "5 Right before serving, stir in the grated Parmesan cheese."
