    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the tomato paste, garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne pepper, brown sugar, cornstarch, and beef broth.",
    "Remove any large pieces of fat from the beef roast, then cut the meat into 2-inch chunks. Place the beef in the slow cooker, then pour the sauce over the meat. Put the lid on the slow cooker, turn the heat onto high, and let cook for 4-5 hours (or 8 hours on low).",
    "After cooking for four hours on high, use tongs to stir and shred the meat in the sauce (if the meat is not yet tender, let it cook longer. It can go longer than four hours, if needed, and will only get more tender the longer it cooks). Keep the heat set on high as you shred the meat to continue to cook down and thicken the sauce. Taste the meat and sauce and add salt if needed. Serve hot over a bed of rice, in tacos, or stuffed into a burrito."
