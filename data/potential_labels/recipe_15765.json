    "Line a 9×5 loaf pan with parchment paper. For a crust, you can either use half of my gluten free pie crust recipe OR take 4 full graham cracker sheets and process into fine crumbs, then press very firmly into the bottom of the loaf pan. Gently melt the coconut butter, if using. In a bowl, evenly stir together all lemon bar ingredients except the coconut oil, and let sit until no longer cold. (This is so the coconut oil doesn’t harden upon hitting the cold yogurt.) Stir in the melted coconut oil, then spread on top of your crust. Freeze 3-4 hours, or until firm enough to slice but not rock hard. Store leftovers in the fridge, or freeze and thaw a little before serving."
