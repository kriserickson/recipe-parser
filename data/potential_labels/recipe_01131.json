    "Meanwhile, prepare and chop all ingredients so you have them ready to go before you start cooking.",
    "In a large skillet, heat butter and oil over medium/high heat. Add onions, garlic, ginger and chopped chile. Cook, stirring occasionally until the onions begin to turn translucent. Add spices – curry powder, cumin, fenugreek, and mustard seeds and stir for another couple of minutes until fragrant.",
    "Add mushrooms, a few pinches of salt, and cook another minute or so. Add carrot, broccoli, cauliflower and cook for another couple of minutes until the mushrooms have started to cook down.",
    "Add tomatoes, a pinch of sugar, coconut milk, and stir to combine. Turn heat down and simmer, stirring occasionally for about 20 more minutes. Add peas and tofu cubes and let simmer over barely any heat until the peas are warmed through.",
    "This is forgiving – ours sat longer due to our fire situation and it tasted better the longer it sat, giving the flavors a longer time to marry together.",
    "Taste and adjust seasonings as you wish. If you would like it creamier add more coconut milk. Add more salt if necessary, etc. Garnish with chopped cilantro.",
    "Serve with cardamom yogurt, naan, and rice if you wish."
