Add cashew butter, rolled oats and cacao (or chocolate) then stir until combined. Refrigerate mixture in bowl for 15 minutes to set. Remove from refrigerator, then form mixture into 1 1/2 inch balls. Makes about 12 balls. Enjoy right away and store remaining bites in a resealable bag in the freezer."
