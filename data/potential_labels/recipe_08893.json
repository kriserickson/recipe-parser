    "DIRECTIONS",
    "Preheat the oven to 215ºC. Cut the tops of the tomatoes off. Using a paring knife, spoon, or fork, clean out the inside of each tomato — think of it as creating a tomato ramekin.",
    "Evenly divide the diced bacon between the four tomatoes. Scramble four eggs separately and pour one by one into each tomato ramekin, right on top of the diced bacon.",
    "Divide the ghee evenly between the four uncooked eggs and top each egg in a tomato. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the tomatoes to taste.",
    "Place the tomatoes in a Pyrex baking dish and bake for 40 or 50 minutes until the eggs are cooked through. Enjoy hot."
