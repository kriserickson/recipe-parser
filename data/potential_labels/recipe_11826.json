    "In large frying pan or electric frying pan with lid (slightly ajar), fry mushrooms in butter over medium heat until softening. Keep cooking until water evaporates. Remove lid of pan. Add seasoning salt; stir-fry until mushrooms are nice and brown. Add whipping cream, parsley and black pepper. Allow to simmer over low heat until whipping cream reduces a bit. This can happen extremely fast. Arrange mushrooms in shallow casserole dish. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted."
