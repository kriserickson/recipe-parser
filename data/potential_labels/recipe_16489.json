    "Soak black eyed peas overnight, then drain, rinse and set aside. In a medium saucepot or large saute pan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over high until it just begins to smoke (keep a close eye on it-- you don't want the oil to darken in color, but you do want it to get very hot). Add the mushrooms in a single layer and let them sear undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until they begin to turn golden on the searing side. Stir continuously for another 1-2 minutes until the mushrooms are golden throughout. Reduce heat to medium.",
    "Add carrots, celery and onion along with the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil. Cook until vegetables are soft and translucent (about 7-10 minutes), then add garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.",
    "Add fire roasted tomatoes, smoked paprika, turmeric, cayenne, chili powder, vegetable stock and soaked black eyed peas to the pan, stir to blend. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium heat, then cover and cook for 25 -30 minutes until the beans are just tender - don't overcook them or they will get mushy. Remove the lid and continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by half. Season with salt to taste. I usually add about 1 tsp. if using a low sodium broth. Salt really makes the other flavors pop!",
    "Serve hot over steamed rice. Garnish with chopped scallions, if desired. May also be served as a warm dip with corn or tortilla chips."
