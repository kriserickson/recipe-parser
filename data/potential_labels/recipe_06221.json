    "Place chicken in baking dish; drizzle well with some Italian dressing. Bake at 350F for 35 Minutes or until done. Meanwhile place mushroom slices into a separate baking dish; cover with more Italian dressing.",
    "Add to oven about 15 minutes after chicken has been placed into oven. Once the chicken is done, transfer to a baking pan and, if using mushroom slices, place them on top of individual chicken breasts; cover with a slice of baby Swiss cheese. If using whole portabellas (caps), place chicken on top of caps, then cheese on top of chicken. Bake an additional 5-10 minutes, or just until cheese melts. Garnish with parsley."
