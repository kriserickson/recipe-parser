    "Dry roast the tomatillos, onion, garlic (with peel on!) and the serrano chile on a griddle (or use a cast-iron or heavy skillet) over medium heat. Once the garlic skins begins to brown, remove from heat, peel and discard the skins. Continue dry-roasting the other vegetables, turning fairly frequently, until they are mostly blackened on each side. Then remove from heat and set aside.",
    "Place the dry-roasted garlic in a molcajete (mortar) with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and mash into a paste with the tejolote (pestle).",
    "Remove stem and skin from the dry roasted serrano and slice in half. Add the serrano to the molcajete and mash into a fine paste. Add the onions and tomatillos one at a time, swirling and grinding until all the tomatillos are incorporated into the salsa.",
    "Season with salt and add the chopped cilantro and lime juice. Stir to combine and serve. (This will keep for four days in the refrigerator.)"
