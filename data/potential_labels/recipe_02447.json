    "Place the salmon into a ceramic container then marinate the fish in the lime juice and olive oil for 20 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, fry the onion, chilli and fennel in some oil for 5 minutes until softened then add the peppers and garlic and cook for a further 3 minutes.",
    "Pour in the passata, coconut milk and stock, bring up to a simmer then cook for 15 minutes.",
    "Place the salmon and prawns into the pan, and gently cook for 5 minutes or until cooked through.",
    "To make the rice, fry the onion in some oil for 5 mins until softened. Add the basmati, coconut milk, stock and some salt, bring to the boil, reduce the heat right down, cover with a lid then cook until all the liquid is evaporated â€“ this will take 25-30 minutes.",
    "Season with salt and pepper and serve up into bowls along with the rice and garnish with the spring onion and coriander. Enjoy with a wedge of lime and a little hot sauce of choice if you want to give it a kick!"
