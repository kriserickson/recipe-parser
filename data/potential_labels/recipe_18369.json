    "Combine spinach, scallions, garlic, turkey, and cumin in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Using a fork, mix gently just to combine. Form turkey mixture into twelve 1/2-inch-thick patties.",

    "Serve turkey-spinach patties on buns with mayonnaise, onion, and pickles.",
    "DO AHEAD: Patties can be formed 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking."
