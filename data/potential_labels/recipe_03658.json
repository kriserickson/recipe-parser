    "In a small saucepan, bring the water and the sugar to a low boil over medium-high, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar dissolves, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and let the simple syrup cool. Transfer to a mason jar or other airtight container and store in the refrigerator (this recipe makes a lot but you can keep it in the fridge for a couple weeks).",
    "To make the tea lemonade, combine tea, lemonade, and 1 1/2Â TB simple syrup in a mason jar with a lid or another sealable container. Shake the mixture to combine (or stir vigorously in a glass) and pour over ice. Serve cold."
