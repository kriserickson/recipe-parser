    "PREPARATION",
    "In a 4-quart stockpot, sauté onions in butter over medium heat for about 8 minutes, or until caramelized to a nice golden brown, stirring frequently so they don't burn.",
    "Add wine and continue to sauté for 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "Slowly stir in flour.",
    "Stirring to keep lumps from forming, add water, onion soup mix, salt and pepper; bring to a boil over high heat.",
    "Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 1 hour and 30 minutes.",
    "Ladle into bowls and place a piece of toasted French bread in each.",
    "TIPS",
    "The traditional topping used for onion soup is Gruyere cheese. If you have trouble finding it, substitute Swiss cheese. Top the toast with a slice or two of cheese and broil for 3 minutes, until cheese is browned and bubbly."
