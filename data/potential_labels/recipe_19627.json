    "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (191 degrees C). Line either two jelly roll pans or one XL baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Place cheese in circles on the baking sheet(s), with even thickness throughout. Sprinkle with cumin and chili powder.",
    "Bake for 5-7 minutes, until the edges start to brown and bubbles start to form.",
    "Meanwhile, setup wooden spoons sitting horizontally across two overturned glasses (see picture above with the cheese on it). This way, they'll be ready once the cheese taco shells are out of the oven.",
    "Remove the pan(s) from the oven and cool without disturbing for about 1 minute.",
    "Use a flat turner or spatula to lift the cheese circles and hang them over the wooden spoons. Let them hang until hardened, about 5 minutes."
