    "The Method:",
    "1.\tPreheat the oven to 350-degrees Fahrenheit. Line a 13x9” baking sheet (with edges) with parchment paper and spray with your favorite nonstick spray for 3easy removal.",
    "2.\tIn a large bowl, combine almond flour and salt. Add in maple syrup and coconut oil. Stir until thoroughly blended. Then, use a spatula to press the mixture into the baking sheet as evenly as possible.",
    "3.\tBake the cookie crust bottom for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown.",
    "4.\tWhile baking, create the caramel sauce by combining ¾ cup coconut oil, ¾ cup grade A maple syrup, cashew butter, and almond butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Mix thoroughly until everything is dissolved. When crust is finished baking, pour caramel over crust. Then, set in the freezer to cool for 1 hour.",
    "5.\tFor the chocolate frosting, combine ¾ cup of melted coconut oil, 2 tbsp. maple syrup, cocoa powder, coconut milk ‘cream’, and sea salt in a blender. Pour and spread over frozen caramel sauce. Freeze an additional 30 minutes until you can easily cut into bars.",
