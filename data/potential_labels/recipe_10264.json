    "The trick to this dish is to cook it on charcoal embers after you’ve already cooked a couple of other dishes. Toss the zucchini with 3 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, and pepper and place on the embers. Cook until charred but still slightly raw, about 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "Transfer to a cutting board and cut into 1-inch pieces, the transfer to a large bowl with the remaining ingredients. Toss well to combine and season with salt and pepper."
