    "Brown the meat in a large skillet over medium-high heat until halfway cooked, breaking it up as little as possible with a spoon. Remove the par-cooked meat from the skillet and add to a food processor. Pulse once or twice until the meat is a finely ground consistency. Add back to the skillet over medium heat and add the rest of the spices, including the cornstarch. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring to evenly distribute the spices; add water. Simmer 5-10 minutes, until the meat is cooked through and the sauce is thick and flavorful."
