    "Ingredients:",
    "1 very large ripe banana",
    "3 tablespoons chia seeds",
    "1 scoop protein powder of choice (I use Sunwarrior Warrior Blend Natural), optional",
    "1/3 cup gluten-free rolled or quick oats",
    "1 cup water (or almond milk)",
    "1/3 cup almond milk (or more water in a pinch, but it wonâ€™t be as creamy)",
    "granola or fresh fruit, for topping",
    "In a medium bowl, mash the banana until mostly smooth.",
    "Stir in chia seeds followed by the protein powder (if using) and oats. It will resemble a very thick paste.",
    "Whisk in the water/almond milk with a fork, until smooth and no clumps remain.",
    "Place in the fridge overnight or for at least 1-2 hours, until the oats are soft and the mixture is thick.",
    "Serve with a sprinkle of granola and fresh fruit, if desired.",
    "This breakfast is the perfect healthy fuel for hiking trails, climbing mountains, and early morning sunrise adventures. I love knowing that I start off the day with a balanced breakfast just in case we end up having a late lunch."
