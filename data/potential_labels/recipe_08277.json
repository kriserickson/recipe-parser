    "What to Do:",
    "On a rimmed baking sheet (or in a baking dish), toss together onion, squash, and chicken with the olive oil (enough to coat), and salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Roast until chicken is cooked through and squash is tender, about 30-40 minutes.",
    "Remove the roasting pan from the oven, and scrape chicken and squash into a big pot on the stove top.",
    "Add the broth, and spices and bring to a simmer.",
    "Once the mixture reaches a simmer, use the back of a wooden spoon to mash some of the pieces of squash. (The broken pieces will help to thicken the soup.)",
    "Continue to simmer for 10-15 minutes to allow soup to thicken.",
    "Serve and season with salt and pepper as needed. Enjoy!"
