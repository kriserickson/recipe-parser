    "Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Lightly oil metal baking sheet with neutral oil like grapeseed, avocado, or canola.",
    "Place quinoa, lentils, and water together in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, then cover pot and reduce to a simmer. Let cook undisturbed for 10-15 minutes until water has been absorbed.",
    "While quinoa-lentil mixture is cooking, saute onions, mushrooms, squash, and corn over medium heat in a bit of olive oil until tender. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and set aside.",
    "When quinoa is done, add to veggies in bowl. Stir to help it cool and add rest of the ingredients. Use your hands, or a large spoon to mix it well.",
    "The mixture should hold together well when you form it into patties. If too moist or sticky add a bit of rice flour a little at a time. Gently form into palm-sized (or smaller) patties, and place on baking sheet evenly spaced apart.",
    "Bake for 7-10 minutes, then flip them over, and bake for another 7 minutes or so. They should be golden brown and crispy. (If you prefer to grill them, bake in the oven for 2-3 minutes each side, to firm them up a bit, then transfer to grill to finish cooking).",
    "For the pumpkin seed-onion cream. In a food processor, process pumpkin seeds, salt, and nutritional yeast into very fine crumbs/powder. Add lemon juice, chopped onion, and black pepper and process again for 10-20 seconds. Slowly drizzle in water until spread-like consistency has been reached and continue processing for another 30 seconds to 1 minute until super creamy. Store in glass jar in fridge, use anyway you like.",
    "Assemble your burgers- spreading your bun, bread, or lettuce with pumpkin seed cream, topping with a burger, and adding avocado, tomato, and fresh greens. Sprinkle with sea salt and youâ€™re done!"
