    "In a small saucepan, stir together the sugar, water and honey. Turn the heat to medium and stir the mixture until the sugar and water dissolve.",
    "Take the syrup mixture off the burner and toss in the rosemary. Let it steep for 5-7 minutes. You should smell the rosemary aroma. Dip a spoon into the syrup and make sure you can taste the rosemary. If you can't taste the rosemary allow it to steep a few minutes longer.",
    "Remove the rosemary and add 1 Teaspoon of vanilla. The heat from the syrup will cause the oils and alcohol in the vanilla to evaporate so it's better to add vanilla at the very end.",
    "Pour your syrup into a container and it's ready to go! It can keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks. Mainly, I use it in coffee with a dash of milk, but it's also fantastic with bourbon, ice cream, and earl gray tea."
