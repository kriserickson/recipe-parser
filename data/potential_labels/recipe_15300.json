    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray the cups of a 24-cup mini muffin pan with nonstick spray or grease well with a little oil.",
    "In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt.",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, egg, and sugar until smooth. Add the milk and vanilla and mix.",
    "Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients. Stir with a whisk just until smooth. Don’t overmix as that can lead to tough muffins! No one wants tough muffins.",
    "Bake 8-10 minutes, until the tops spring back when you poke them and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out dry.",
    "Remove from oven and place on a rack to cool for about 5 minutes. Using a butter knife to help pry the muffins out of their cups, gently remove the muffins and place them on a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.",
    "Cut muffins in half, spread on 1/2 teaspoon of jam on the insides of each bottom half, and then replace the top.",
    "Muffins keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 days."
