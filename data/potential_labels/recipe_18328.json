    "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "Select the 'Saute' function and pre-heat the Instant Pot.",
    "Add olive oil to the inner pot.",
    "Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. (If the beef browns too quickly, press ‘Cancel’ until the Instant Pot cools down a bit and press the ‘Saute’ button again.)",
    "Drain fat or remove fat from beef with a small ladle.",
    "Add onion and garlic. Stir until onion is translucent.",
    "Stir in salt, sugar, dried basil, dried oregano, black pepper and crushed red pepper.",
    "Deglaze pot with a tablespoon or two of broth, stirring until liquid has nearly evaporated.",
    "Press ‘Cancel’ to turn Instant Pot off.",
    "Add remaining broth and stir.",
    "Add crushed tomatoes and tomato paste, but don’t stir.",
    "Divide spaghetti into three batches. Add spaghetti to the inner pot in a criss-cross pattern: add one-third of spaghetti over the tomatoes, spreading it out horizontally. Add the next one-third of spaghetti, spreading out vertically. Add the final layer, spreading out horizontally. (see blog post for step by step photos).",
    "Using a spatula, push down on spaghetti until submerged in the liquid.",
    "Close the lid and pressure cook for 6 minutes.",
    "Do a 2 to 5 minute Natural Pressure Release (NPR 2 to 5). *",
    "Open the lid and stir spaghetti and meat sauce until combined. If there are any strands of spaghetti stuck together, use a fork to separate the strands.",
    "If you find the spaghetti to be too liquidy, allow it to rest for about 5 minutes, and it will absorb the extra liquid.",
    "Sprinkle with chopped parsley and shredded parmesan cheese before serving."
