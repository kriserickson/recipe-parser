    "Place the quinoa in a medium bowl, soak with plenty of water and place in the refrigerator overnight. Place the chia seeds in a small bowl, cover with 1/2 cup water and soak overnight in the refrigerator.",
    "The following morning, preheat the oven to 170 degrees celcius.",
    "Drain the quinoa, rinse well through a sieve, ensuring that you drain all the water. Place the quinoa, chia seeds, 1/2 cup water, olive oil, baking soda, sea salt and lemon juice into a high speed blender (I use an Omniblend*) or food processor, mix for 3 minutes or until the bread mix resembles a batter like consistency. Pour or spoon the mixture into a lined loaf tin, bake for 90 minutes or until the bread is firm bounces back when touched.",
    "Remove from the oven and cool for at least 30 minutes, then remove from the loaf pan and let it cool completely on a rack. Serve and enjoy.",
