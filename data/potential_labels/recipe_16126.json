    "Instructions",
    "Mix all ingredients in a bowl, adding the chocolate chips last.",
    "Don't forget to taste and adjust the sweetness to your taste!",
    "Roll into balls.",
    "If you're making the ganache, melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave (gentle heat!) or in a water bath. Mix. Fill into a plastic sandwich or freezer bag, pinch off a corner/poke a hole into it and get decorating. You can also fold baking paper into a triangular shape so it makes a funnel and pinch off the bottom. Alternatively, just dunk the balls in the melted chocolate mix.",
    "Recipe Notes",
    "My cookie dough balls weighed around 15 grams each. They were about 2 bites per ball.",
    "I think 2 balls are a good portion for a dessert/snack.",
    "To keep things simple, I have calculated the nutrition info for 1 cookie dough ball and not included the chocolate ganache.",
    "If you cannot get hold of sugar free chocolate chips, you can use very dark chocolate (85%-90% cocoa solids) instead and just break it into small pieces.",
    "For a drier/crumblier cookie dough add 1 tbsp of coconut flour",
