    "Cook quinoa and brown rice according to package directions.",
    "Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Add brown rice to food processor and process, adding water one tablespoon at a time. You want to add enough water just so that the brown rice can be processed. The brown rice will start to break down and get very sticky.",
    "Add quinoa and soy sauce and process again.",
    "Remove mixture from food processor and place into a separate bowl. It will be very sticky, so don’t be alarmed.",
    "Add in remaining seasonings and mix together.",
    "On a well-oiled baking sheet, place a portion of the mix that you think will thinly cover the pan. This is more of an art than a science and depends on the cracker thickness desired. We wanted our crackers thin, so we started with roughly 1 cup of dough per pan.",
    "Take parchment paper the size of the pan and cover thoroughly with oil. Take the parchment paper, oil side down, and begin to press down the mix. Once it’s relatively flat, take a rolling pin, can, anything round will work, and work the mixture to the sides of the baking sheet.",
    "Once you have evenly spread the mixture out, you can either keep the mixture as one big sheet and break the cracker apart once they're baked, score the mixture into desired shape before you put them into the oven, or cut them into circular rounds (I used the top of a spice container).",
    "Bake until dry and slightly brown, about 20-25 mins. This will vary by oven, by thickness, and by how much water you added in step 2.",
    "Use a spatula to remove the cracker from the pan. Allow to cool and enjoy!"
