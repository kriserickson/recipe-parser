    "Cake: Spray the bottom of a 9×13 inch cake pan with cooking spray. Place one layer of graham crackers on the bottom, cutting to completely cover the bottom. In mixing bowl mix the pudding, peanut butter and milk with electric mixer. Mix for 2 minutes. Fold in the Cool Whip. Spread half the pudding mix on top of the first layer of crackers. Place a second layer of graham crackers on top. Spoon the remaining pudding mix on 2nd layer of crackers. Finish with a third layer of graham crackers. Spread frosting on top of the last layer of graham crackers all the way to the edge. Place in the fridge overnight so that the crackers become soft and moist. Slice and serve. Garnish with peanut butter cups if desired.",
    "Frosting: In small mixer bowl combine all ingredients and beat until smooth. This pic looks like they may have used chocolate graham crackers instead of the original flavor.”"
