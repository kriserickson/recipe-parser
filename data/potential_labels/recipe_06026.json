    "Preheat your oven to 350F and line an 8\" x 8\" baking dish with parchment paper, to prevent sticking. In a small bowl, stir together the tablespoon of ground flax seed with 3 tablespoons of water, and allow to sit for 10 minutes, until gelled together.",
    "In the meantime, whisk together the dry ingredients in a medium mixing bowl, including the buckwheat flour, spices, baking soda and salt. Add the gelled flax mixture to the dry ingredients, and stir in the melted coconut oil, zucchini puree, blackstrap molasses, maple syrup and vanilla extract. Mix well until a uniform batter is formed.",
    "Transfer the batter to the lined baking dish, and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake at 350F for 25-30 minutes, or until the top begins to crack and the center is firm.",
    "Allow to cool completely, then slice into bars and serve! Feel free to top with a sprinkle of coconut sugar, for presentation, if desired."
