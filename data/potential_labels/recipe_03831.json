    "Lightly oil a small non-stick pan or a crepe pan (about 5 - 6 inches diameter) over a moderate heat. When the pan is hot, add about 1/2 cup of batter, evenly coating the pan. Cook for about 1 minute until the batter sets and form small bubbles. Sprinkle some sugar evenly and cover with a lid. Cook for another minute. Then sprinkle some ground peanuts on top of the pancake. Continue to cook until the pancake is light golden brown in color. Loosen the edges with a palette knife.Fold the pancake into half, and transfer it onto a plate. Slice into 2 or 3 pieces and serve warm."
