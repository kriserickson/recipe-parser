    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with tin foil and top wire cooling racks so your chicken can cook more evenly and not get stuck to the sheet. Use baking spray on your wire racks to help the cleaning process.",
    "In a large bowl sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper onto your chicken drumsticks.",
    "Put the cornstarch over top and mix up the drumsticks until all of them are evenly coated.",
    "Put your chicken onto the baking sheet and bake until golden and crispy. Usually it will be able 45-50 minutes.",
    "While you cook the chicken you can prepare your sauce. Melt butter into the sauce pan, adding the honey and Sriracha stirring until combined.",
    "When your chicken is cooked, brush the Sriracha-honey mixture over the drumsticks and enjoy!"
