    "2. While the squash is roasting, combine the apple cider, vinegar, and shallots in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook for 6-10 minutes, until the cider is reduced to about 1/4 cup. Off the heat, whisk in the mustard, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.",
    "3. Place the spinach in a large salad bowl and add the roasted squash, dried cherries, walnuts, and the grated Parmesan. Spoon just enough vinaigrette over the salad to moisten, and toss well. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve immediately."
