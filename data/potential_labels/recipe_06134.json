    "Combine cinnamon sticks, ginger, cloves, and 1½ cups water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Whisk in pumpkin purée, condensed milk, cream, syrup, and salt and cook, whisking frequently, until mixture is thick and pudding-like in consistency, about 5 minutes. Whisk in vanilla and nutmeg, then strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on solids with a spatula to release as much liquid as possible, into a large bowl.",
    "For each latte, stir together 2–4 Tbsp. pumpkin spice purée (depending how sweet you’d like it) and 1½ oz. hot espresso in your favorite mug. Top with steamed milk and a little bit of freshly grated cinnamon."
