    "Whisk egg yolks and butter together in a small dish and brush lightly over surface of pastry dough.",
    "Sprinkle each sheet with cheese and onions, cover with plastic wrap and roll with pin gently to press into dough.",
    "Cut each sheet into ½ strips lengthwise and twist each strip 4-5 times.",
    "Lay strips on non-stick baking sheets and bake until puffed and golden brown (10-12 minutes). This is a great accompaniment to your favorite soups."
