    "Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Wait until you have prepared all the ingredients (such as grating the cheese, mincing the garlic, etc), before you drop the pasta in. Combine the grated cheese with the beaten egg and yolk in a bowl.",
    "Heat a large skillet or chefâ€™s pan over medium-high and add the bacon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until just browned and crispy, about 1-2 minutes. Add the kale, garlic and a pinch of salt. Lower heat to medium or medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, 2-3 minutes, or until the kale is dark green and completely wilted.",
    "As soon as pasta is al dente, transfer with tongs to the pan of kale and bacon, and remove from heat. Stir in the egg and cheese mixture. Toss thoroughly (making sure the heat is not on, so as to not cook the eggs). Stir in the tablespoon of olive oil or butter and extra black pepper to taste, and serve immediately."
