    "Put all the ingredients into a blender or food processor and blend until everything is smooth. Cover the base of a non-stick frying pan or skillet with the lightest coating of oil maginable – use a sheet of kitchen paper to mop up any extra (melted coconut oil is a good option). It’s just so that your pancake won’t stick to the pan.",
    "Put the pan on a high heat and give it a few minutes to heat up. We want a nice hot pan. Drop in dollops of your pancake mixture and leave them to cook for 3–4 minutes on each side. You’ll know they’re done when they start to bubble a little and turn golden.",
    "Some tasty serving ideas are to top with soya yoghurt, fresh fruit or fruit compote and honey, or simply a little lemon and honey. Or try a savoury pancake with hummus, roasted peppers and mixed leaves."
