    "In a large bowl, combined the teff flour, kefir, water, vinegar and salt until the mixture has the texture of a thick pancake batter. Add more water if necessary. Cover with a kitchen towel and set aside for at least an hour (up to 12 hours should be fine based on everything I have read on soaking grains, though I have not tried that myself). Heat a nonstick skillet on high. Drop a little water to see if it sizzles. If so, turn heat down to medium. Heat about a teaspoon grapeseed oil in a nonstick skillet. Using a 1/2 cup measure, pour 1/2 cup of the batter in a circular motion so that the flatbread is no more than 1/4 inch thick, preferably even a bit thinner. Cook until bubbles start to form and the surface of the flatbread becomes matte, which should take about five minutes. Flip the flatbread and cook until firm, which should be about 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat three more times. Recipe should yield four pancakes."
