    "Preheat the grill, setting the burners to medium. Grill the chicken until cooked through, about 8 minutes per side. If necessary, lower the temperature to avoid burning. Keep warm. Brush the fennel and peaches with oil. In a perforated grill wok or pizza plate, grill the fennel until tender. Season with salt and pepper. Grill the peaches for about 2 minutes per side. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the chicken with the fennel and peaches. Serve sour cream on the side.",
